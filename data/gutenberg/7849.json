{"summary": "On his thirtieth birthday, the chief financial officer of a bank, Josef K., is unexpectedly arrested by two unidentified agents from an unspecified agency for an unspecified crime. The agents' boss later arrives and holds a mini-tribunal in the room of K.'s neighbor, Fräulein Bürstner. K. is not taken away, however, but left \"free\" and told to await instructions from the Committee of Affairs. He goes to work, and that night apologizes to Fräulein Bürstner for the intrusion into her room. At the end of the conversation he suddenly kisses her.\nK. receives a phone call summoning him to court, and the coming Sunday is arranged as the date. No time is set, but the address is given to him. The address turns out to be a huge tenement building. K. has to explore to find the court, which turns out to be in the attic. The room is airless, shabby, and crowded, and although he has no idea what he is charged with, or what authorizes the process, K. makes a long speech denigrating the whole process, including the agents who arrested him; during this speech an attendant's wife and a man engage in sexual activities. K. then returns home.\nK. later goes to visit the court again, although he has not been summoned, and finds that it is not in session. He instead talks with the attendant's wife, who attempts to seduce him into taking her away, and who gives him more information about the process and offers to help him. K. later goes with the attendant to a higher level of the attic where the shabby and airless offices of the court are housed.\nK. returns home to find Fräulein Montag, a lodger from another room, moving in with Fräulein Bürstner. He suspects that this is to prevent him from pursuing his affair with the latter woman. Yet another lodger, Captain Lanz, appears to be in league with Montag.\nLater, in a store room at his own bank, K. discovers the two agents who arrested him being whipped by a flogger for asking K. for bribes and as a result of complaints K. made at court. K. tries to argue with the flogger, saying that the men need not be whipped, but the flogger cannot be swayed. The next day he returns to the store room and is shocked to find everything as he had found it the day before, including the whipper and the two agents.\nK. is visited by his uncle, who was K.'s guardian. The uncle seems distressed by K.'s predicament. At first sympathetic, he becomes concerned that K. is underestimating the seriousness of the case. The uncle introduces K. to a lawyer, who is attended by Leni, a nurse, who K.'s uncle suspects is the advocate's mistress. During the discussion it becomes clear how different this process is from regular legal proceedings: guilt is assumed, the bureaucracy running it is vast with many levels, and everything is secret, from the charge, to the rules of the court, to the authority behind the courts – even the identity of the judges at the higher levels. The attorney tells him that he can prepare a brief for K., but since the charge is unknown and the rules are unknown, it is difficult work. It also never may be read, but is still very important. The lawyer says that his most important task is to deal with powerful court officials behind the scenes. As they talk, the lawyer reveals that the Chief Clerk of the Court has been sitting hidden in the darkness of a corner. The Chief Clerk emerges to join the conversation, but K. is called away by Leni, who takes him to the next room, where she offers to help him and seduces him. They have a sexual encounter. Afterwards K. meets his uncle outside, who is angry, claiming that K.'s lack of respect has hurt K.'s case.\nK. visits the lawyer several times. The lawyer tells him incessantly how dire his situation is and tells many stories of other hopeless clients and of his behind-the-scenes efforts on behalf of these clients, and brags about his many connections. The brief is never complete. K.'s work at the bank deteriorates as he is consumed with worry about his case.\nK. is surprised by one of his bank clients, who tells K. that he is aware that K. is dealing with a trial. The client learned of K.'s case from Titorelli, a painter, who has dealings with the court and told the client about K.'s case. The client advises K. to go to Titorelli for advice. Titorelli lives in the attic of a tenement in a suburb on the opposite side of town from the court that K. visited. Three teenage girls taunt K. on the steps and tease him sexually. Titorelli turns out to be an official painter of portraits for the court – an inherited position – and has a deep understanding of the process. K. learns that, to Titorelli's knowledge, not a single defendant has ever been acquitted. He sets out K.'s options and offers to help K. with either. The options are: obtain a provisional verdict of innocence from the lower court, which can be overturned at any time by higher levels of the court, which would lead to re-initiation of the process; or curry favor with the lower judges to keep the process moving at a glacial pace. Titorelli has K. leave through a small back door, as the girls are blocking the door through which K. entered. To K.'s shock, the door opens into another warren of the court's offices – again shabby and airless.\nK. decides to take control of matters himself and visits his lawyer with the intention of dismissing him. At the lawyer's office he meets a downtrodden individual, Block, a client who offers K. some insight from a client's perspective. Block's case has continued for five years and he has gone from being a successful businessman to being almost bankrupt and is virtually enslaved by his dependence on the lawyer and Leni, with whom he appears to be sexually involved. The lawyer mocks Block in front of K. for his dog-like subservience. This experience further poisons K.'s opinion of his lawyer. (This chapter was left unfinished by the author.)\nK. is asked by the bank to show an Italian client around local places of cultural interest, but the Italian client, short of time, asks K. to take him only to the cathedral, setting a time to meet there. When the client does not show up, K. explores the cathedral, which is empty except for an old woman and a church official. K. notices a priest who seems to be preparing to give a sermon from a small second pulpit, and K. begins to leave, lest it begin and K. be compelled to stay for its entirety. Instead of giving a sermon, the priest calls out K.'s name. K. approaches the pulpit and the priest berates him for his attitude toward the trial and for seeking help, especially from women. K. asks him to come down and the two men walk inside the cathedral. The priest works for the court as a chaplain and tells K. a fable (which was published earlier as \"Before the Law\") that is meant to explain his situation. K. and the priest discuss the parable. The priest tells K. that the parable is an ancient text of the court, and many generations of court officials have interpreted it differently.\nOn the eve of K.'s thirty-first birthday, two men arrive at his apartment. He has been waiting for them, and he offers little resistance – indeed the two men take direction from K. as they walk through town. K. leads them to a quarry where the two men place K's head on a discarded block. One of the men produces a double-edged butcher knife, and as the two men pass it back and forth between them, the narrator tells us that \"K. knew then precisely, that it would have been his duty to take the knife...and thrust it into himself.\" He does not take the knife. One of the men holds his shoulder and pulls him up and the other man stabs him in the heart and twists the knife twice. K.'s last words are: \"Like a dog!\"\n\n", "full_text": "The Trial\nFranz Kafka\n\nTranslation Copyright (C) by David Wyllie\nTranslator contact email: dandelion@post.cz\n\n\n\n\nChapter One\nArrest - Conversation with Mrs. Grubach - Then Miss Buerstner\n\n        Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K., he knew he had\ndone nothing wrong but, one morning, he was arrested.  Every day at\neight in the morning he was brought his breakfast by  Mrs. Grubach's\ncook - Mrs. Grubach was his landlady - but today she didn't come.  That\nhad never happened before.  K. waited a little while, looked from his\npillow at the old woman who lived opposite and who was watching him with\nan inquisitiveness quite unusual for her, and finally, both hungry and\ndisconcerted, rang the bell.  There was immediately a knock at the door\nand a man entered.  He had never seen the man in this house before.  He\nwas slim but firmly built, his clothes were black and close-fitting,\nwith many folds and pockets, buckles and buttons and a belt, all of\nwhich gave the impression of being very practical but without making it\nvery clear what they were actually for.  \"Who are you?\" asked K.,\nsitting half upright in his bed.  The man, however, ignored the question\nas if his arrival simply had to be accepted, and merely replied, \"You\nrang?\"  \"Anna should have brought me my breakfast,\" said K.  He tried to\nwork out who the man actually was, first in silence, just through\nobservation and by thinking about it, but the man didn't stay still to\nbe looked at for very long.  Instead he went over to the door, opened it\nslightly, and said to someone who was clearly standing immediately\nbehind it, \"He wants Anna to bring him his breakfast.\"  There was a\nlittle laughter in the neighbouring room, it was not clear from the\nsound of it whether there were several people laughing.  The strange man\ncould not have learned anything from it that he hadn't known already,\nbut now he said to K., as if making his report \"It is not possible.\"\n\"It would be the first time that's happened,\" said K., as he jumped out\nof bed and quickly pulled on his trousers.  \"I want to see who that is\nin the next room, and why it is that Mrs. Grubach has let me be\ndisturbed in this way.\"  It immediately occurred to him that he needn't\nhave said this out loud, and that he must to some extent have\nacknowledged their authority by doing so, but that didn't seem important\nto him at the time.  That, at least, is how the stranger took it, as he\nsaid, \"Don't you think you'd better stay where you are?\"  \"I want\nneither to stay here nor to be spoken to by you until you've introduced\nyourself.\"  \"I meant it for your own good,\" said the stranger and opened\nthe door, this time without being asked.  The next room, which K.\nentered more slowly than he had intended, looked at first glance exactly\nthe same as it had the previous evening.  It was Mrs. Grubach's living\nroom, over-filled with furniture, tablecloths, porcelain and\nphotographs.  Perhaps there was a little more space in there than usual\ntoday, but if so it was not immediately obvious, especially as the main\ndifference was the presence of a man sitting by the open window with a\nbook from which he now looked up.  \"You should have stayed in your room!\nDidn't Franz tell you?\"  \"And what is it you want, then?\" said K.,\nlooking back and forth between this new acquaintance and the one named\nFranz, who had remained in the doorway.  Through the open window he\nnoticed the old woman again, who had come close to the window opposite\nso that she could continue to see everything.  She was showing an\ninquisitiveness that really made it seem like she was going senile. \"I\nwant to see Mrs. Grubach ...,\" said K., making a movement as if tearing\nhimself away from the two men - even though they were standing well away\nfrom him - and wanted to go.  \"No,\" said the man at the window, who\nthrew his book down on a coffee table and stood up.  \"You can't go away\nwhen you're under arrest.\"  \"That's how it seems,\" said K.  \"And why am\nI under arrest?\" he then asked.  \"That's something we're not allowed to\ntell you.  Go into your room and wait there.  Proceedings are underway\nand you'll learn about everything all in good time.  It's not really\npart of my job to be friendly towards you like this, but I hope no-one,\napart from Franz, will hear about it, and he's been more friendly\ntowards you than he should have been, under the rules, himself.  If you\ncarry on having as much good luck as you have been with your arresting\nofficers then you can reckon on things going well with you.\"  K. wanted\nto sit down, but then he saw that, apart from the chair by the window,\nthere was nowhere anywhere in the room where he could sit.  \"You'll get\nthe chance to see for yourself how true all this is,\" said Franz and\nboth men then walked up to K.  They were significantly bigger than him,\nespecially the second man, who frequently slapped him on the shoulder.\nThe two of them felt K.'s nightshirt, and said he would now have to wear\none that was of much lower quality, but that they would keep the\nnightshirt along with his other underclothes and return them to him if\nhis case turned out well.  \"It's better for you if you give us the\nthings than if you leave them in the storeroom,\" they said.  \"Things\nhave a tendency to go missing in the storeroom, and after a certain\namount of time they sell things off, whether the case involved has come\nto an end or not.  And cases like this can last a long time, especially\nthe ones that have been coming up lately.  They'd give you the money\nthey got for them, but it wouldn't be very much as it's not what they're\noffered for them when they sell them that counts, it's how much they get\nslipped on the side, and things like that lose their value anyway when\nthey get passed on from hand to hand, year after year.\"  K. paid hardly\nany attention to what they were saying, he did not place much value on\nwhat he may have still possessed or on who decided what happened to\nthem.  It was much more important to him to get a clear understanding of\nhis position, but he could not think clearly while these people were\nhere, the second policeman's belly - and they could only be policemen -\nlooked friendly enough, sticking out towards him, but when K. looked up\nand saw his dry, boney face it did not seem to fit with the body.   His\nstrong nose twisted to one side as if ignoring K. and sharing an\nunderstanding with the other policeman.  What sort of people were these?\nWhat were they talking about?  What office did they belong to?  K. was\nliving in a free country, after all, everywhere was at peace, all laws\nwere decent and were upheld, who was it who dared accost him in his own\nhome?  He was always inclined to take life as lightly as he could, to\ncross bridges when he came to them, pay no heed for the future, even\nwhen everything seemed under threat.  But here that did not seem the\nright thing to do.  He could have taken it all as a joke, a big joke set\nup by his colleagues at the bank for some unknown reason, or also\nperhaps because today was his thirtieth birthday, it was all possible of\ncourse, maybe all he had to do was laugh in the policemen's face in some\nway and they would laugh with him, maybe they were tradesmen from the\ncorner of the street, they looked like they might be - but he was\nnonetheless determined, ever since he first caught sight of the one\ncalled Franz, not to lose any slight advantage he might have had over\nthese people.  There was a very slight risk that people would later say\nhe couldn't understand a joke, but - although he wasn't normally in the\nhabit of learning from experience - he might also have had a few\nunimportant occasions in mind when, unlike his more cautious friends, he\nhad acted with no thought at all for what might follow and had been made\nto suffer for it. He didn't want that to happen again, not this time at\nleast; if they were play-acting he would act along with them.\n\n        He still had time.  \"Allow me,\" he said, and hurried between the\ntwo policemen through into his room.  \"He seems sensible enough,\" he\nheard them say behind him.  Once in his room, he quickly pulled open the\ndrawer of his writing desk, everything in it was very tidy but in his\nagitation he was unable to find the identification documents he was\nlooking for straight away.  He finally found his bicycle permit and was\nabout to go back to the policemen with it when it seemed to him too\npetty, so he carried on searching until he found his birth certificate.\nJust as he got back in the adjoining room the door on the other side\nopened and Mrs. Grubach was about to enter.  He only saw her for an\ninstant, for as soon as she recognised K. she was clearly embarrassed,\nasked for forgiveness and disappeared, closing the door behind her very\ncarefully.  \"Do come in,\" K. could have said just then. But now he stood\nin the middle of the room with his papers in his hand and still looking\nat the door which did not open again.  He stayed like that until he was\nstartled out of it by the shout of the policeman who sat at the little\ntable at the open window and, as K. now saw, was eating his breakfast.\n\"Why didn't she come in?\" he asked.  \"She's not allowed to,\" said the\nbig policeman.  \"You're under arrest, aren't you.\"  \"But how can I be\nunder arrest? And how come it's like this?\"  \"Now you're starting\nagain,\" said the policeman, dipping a piece of buttered bread in the\nhoneypot.  \"We don't answer questions like that.\"  \"You will have to\nanswer them,\" said K.  \"Here are my identification papers, now show me\nyours and I certainly want to see the arrest warrant.\"  \"Oh, my God!\"\nsaid the policeman.  \"In a position like yours, and you think you can\nstart giving orders, do you?  It won't do you any good to get us on the\nwrong side, even if you think it will - we're probably more on your side\nthat anyone else you know!\"  \"That's true, you know, you'd better\nbelieve it,\" said Franz, holding a cup of coffee in his hand which he\ndid not lift to his mouth but looked at K. in a way that was probably\nmeant to be full of meaning but could not actually be understood.  K.\nfound himself, without intending it, in a mute dialogue with Franz, but\nthen slapped his hand down on his papers and said, \"Here are my identity\ndocuments.\"  \"And what do you want us to do about it?\" replied the big\npoliceman, loudly.  \"The way you're carrying on, it's worse than a\nchild. What is it you want?  Do you want to get this great, bloody trial\nof yours over with quickly by talking about ID and arrest warrants with\nus?  We're just coppers, that's all we are.  Junior officers like us\nhardly know one end of an ID card from another, all we've got to do with\nyou is keep an eye on you for ten hours a day and get paid for it.\nThat's all we are.  Mind you, what we can do is make sure that the high\nofficials we work for find out just what sort of person it is they're\ngoing to arrest, and why he should be arrested, before they issue the\nwarrant.  There's no mistake there.   Our authorities as far as I know,\nand I only know the lowest grades, don't go out looking for guilt among\nthe public; it's the guilt that draws them out, like it says in the law,\nand they have to send us police officers out.  That's the law. Where\nd'you think there'd be any mistake there?\"  \"I don't know this law,\"\nsaid K.  \"So much the worse for you, then,\" said the policeman.  \"It's\nprobably exists only in your heads,\" said K., he wanted, in some way, to\ninsinuate his way into the thoughts of the policemen, to re-shape those\nthoughts to his benefit or to make himself at home there.  But the\npoliceman just said dismissively, \"You'll find out when it affects you.\"\nFranz joined in, and said, \"Look at this, Willem, he admits he doesn't\nknow the law and at the same time insists he's innocent.\"  \"You're quite\nright, but we can't get him to understand a thing,\" said the other.  K.\nstopped talking with them; do I, he thought to himself, do I really have\nto carry on getting tangled up with the chattering of base functionaries\nlike this? - and they admit themselves that they are of the lowest\nposition.  They're talking about things of which they don't have the\nslightest understanding, anyway.  It's only because of their stupidity\nthat they're able to be so sure of themselves.  I just need  few words\nwith someone of the same social standing as myself and everything will\nbe incomparably clearer, much clearer than a long conversation with\nthese two can make it.  He walked up and down the free space in the room\na couple of times, across the street he could see the old woman who,\nnow, had pulled an old man, much older than herself, up to the window\nand had her arms around him.  K. had to put an end to this display,\n\"Take me to your superior,\" he said.  \"As soon as he wants to see you.\nNot before,\" said the policeman, the one called Willem.  \"And now my\nadvice to you,\" he added, \"is to go into your room, stay calm, and wait\nand see what's to be done with you.  If you take our advice, you won't\ntire yourself out thinking about things to no purpose, you need to pull\nyourself together as there's a lot that's going to required of you.\nYou've not behaved towards us the way we deserve after being so good to\nyou, you forget that we, whatever we are, we're still free men and\nyou're not, and that's quite an advantage.  But in spite of all that\nwe're still willing, if you've got the money, to go and get you some\nbreakfast from the cafe over the road.\"\n\n        Without giving any answer to this offer, K. stood still for some\ntime.  Perhaps, if he opened the door of the next room or even the front\ndoor, the two of them would not dare to stand in his way, perhaps that\nwould be the simplest way to settle the whole thing, by bringing it to a\nhead.  But maybe they would grab him, and if he were thrown down on the\nground he would lose all the advantage he, in a certain respect, had\nover them.  So he decided on the more certain solution, the way things\nwould go in the natural course of events, and went back in his room\nwithout another word either from him or from the policemen.\n\n        He threw himself down on his bed, and from the dressing table he\ntook the nice apple that he had put there the previous evening for his\nbreakfast.   Now it was all the breakfast he had and anyway, as he\nconfirmed as soon as he took his first, big bite of it, it was far\nbetter than a breakfast he could have had through the good will of the\npolicemen from the dirty cafe.  He felt well and confident, he had\nfailed to go into work at the bank this morning but that could easily be\nexcused because of the relatively high position he held there.  Should\nhe really send in his explanation?   He wondered about it.  If nobody\nbelieved him, and in this case that would be understandable, he could\nbring Mrs. Grubach in as a witness, or even the old pair from across the\nstreet, who probably even now were on their way over to the window\nopposite.  It puzzled K., at least it puzzled him looking at it from the\npolicemen's point of view, that they had made him go into the room and\nleft him alone there, where he had ten different ways of killing\nhimself.  At the same time, though, he asked himself, this time looking\nat it from his own point of view, what reason he could have to do so.\nBecause those two were sitting there in the next room and had taken his\nbreakfast, perhaps?  It would have been so pointless to kill himself\nthat, even if he had wanted to, the pointlessness would have made him\nunable.  Maybe, if the policemen had not been so obviously limited in\ntheir mental abilities, it could have been supposed that they had come\nto the same conclusion and saw no danger in leaving him alone because of\nit.  They could watch now, if they wanted, and see how he went over to\nthe cupboard in the wall where he kept a bottle of good schnapps, how he\nfirst emptied a glass of it in place of his breakfast and how he then\ntook a second glassful in order to give himself courage, the last one\njust as a precaution for the unlikely chance it would be needed.\n\n        Then he was so startled by a shout to him from the other room that\nhe struck his teeth against the glass.  \"The supervisor wants to see\nyou!\" a voice said.  It was only the shout that startled him, this curt,\nabrupt, military shout, that he would not have expected from the\npoliceman called Franz.  In itself, he found the order very welcome.\n\"At last!\" he called back, locked the cupboard and, without delay,\nhurried into the next room.  The two policemen were standing there and\nchased him back into his bedroom as if that were a matter of course.\n\"What d'you think you're doing?\" they cried.  \"Think you're going to see\nthe supervisor dressed in just your shirt, do you?  He'd see to it you\ngot a right thumping, and us and all!\"  \"Let go of me for God's sake!\"\ncalled K., who had already been pushed back as far as his wardrobe, \"if\nyou accost me when I'm still in bed you can't expect to find me in my\nevening dress.\"  \"That won't help you,\" said the policemen, who always\nbecame very quiet, almost sad, when K. began to shout, and in that way\nconfused him or, to some extent, brought him to his senses.  \"Ridiculous\nformalities!\" he grumbled, as he lifted his coat from the chair and kept\nit in both his hands for a little while, as if holding it out for the\npolicemen's inspection.  They shook their heads.  \"It's got to be a\nblack coat,\"  they said.  At that, K. threw the coat to the floor and\nsaid - without knowing even himself what he meant by it - \"Well it's not\ngoing to be the main trial, after all.\"  The policemen laughed, but\ncontinued to insist, \"It's got to be a black coat.\"  \"Well that's\nalright by me if it makes things go any faster,\" said K.  He opened the\nwardrobe himself, spent a long time searching through all the clothes,\nand chose his best black suit which had a short jacket that had greatly\nsurprised those who knew him, then he also pulled out a fresh shirt and\nbegan, carefully, to get dressed.  He secretly told himself that he had\nsucceeded in speeding things up by letting the policemen forget to make\nhim have a bath.  He watched them to see if they might remember after\nall, but of course it never occurred to them, although Willem did not\nforget to send Franz up to the supervisor with the message saying that\nK. was getting dressed.\n\n        Once he was properly dressed, K. had to pass by Willem as he went\nthrough the next room into the one beyond, the door of which was already\nwide open.  K. knew very well that this room had recently been let to a\ntypist called 'Miss Buerstner'.  She was in the habit of going out to\nwork very early and coming back home very late, and K. had never\nexchanged more than a few words of greeting with her.  Now, her bedside\ntable had been pulled into the middle of the room to be used as a desk\nfor these proceedings, and the supervisor sat behind it.  He had his\nlegs crossed, and had thrown one arm over the backrest of the chair.\n\n        In one corner of the room there were three young people looking at\nthe photographs belonging to Miss Buerstner that had been put into a\npiece of fabric on the wall.  Hung up on the handle of the open window\nwas a white blouse.  At the window across the street, there was the old\npair again, although now their number had increased, as behind them, and\nfar taller than they were, stood a man with an open shirt that showed\nhis chest and a reddish goatee beard which he squeezed and twisted with\nhis fingers.  \"Josef K.?\" asked the supervisor, perhaps merely to\nattract K.'s attention as he looked round the room.  K. nodded.  \"I\ndaresay you were quite surprised by all that's been taking place this\nmorning,\" said the supervisor as, with both hands, he pushed away the\nfew items on the bedside table - the candle and box of matches, a book\nand a pin cushion which lay there as if they were things he would need\nfor his own business.  \"Certainly,\" said K., and he began to feel\nrelaxed now that, at last, he stood in front of someone with some sense,\nsomeone with whom he would be able to talk about his situation.\n\"Certainly I'm surprised, but I'm not in any way very surprised.\"\n\"You're not very surprised?\" asked the supervisor, as he positioned the\ncandle in the middle of the table and the other things in a group around\nit.  \"Perhaps you don't quite understand me,\" K. hurriedly pointed out.\n\"What I mean is ...\" here K. broke off what he was saying and looked\nround for somewhere to sit.  \"I may sit down, mayn't I?\" he asked.\n\"That's not usual,\" the supervisor answered.  \"What I mean is...,\" said\nK. without delaying a second time, \"that, yes, I am very surprised but\nwhen you've been in the world for thirty years already and had to make\nyour own way through everything yourself, which has been my lot, then\nyou become hardened to surprises and don't take them too hard.\nEspecially not what's happened today.\"  \"Why especially not what's\nhappened today?\"  \"I wouldn't want to say that I see all of this as a\njoke, you seem to have gone to too much trouble making all these\narrangements for that.  Everyone in the house must be taking part in it\nas well as all of you, that would be going beyond what could be a joke.\nSo I don't want to say that this is a joke.\"  \"Quite right,\" said the\nsupervisor, looking to see how many matches were left in the box.  \"But\non the other hand,\" K. went on, looking round at everyone there and even\nwishing he could get the attention of the three who were looking at the\nphotographs,  \"on the other hand this really can't be all that\nimportant.  That follows from the fact that I've been indicted, but\ncan't think of the slightest  offence for which I could be indicted.\nBut even that is all beside the point, the main question is: Who is\nissuing the indictment?  What office is conducting this affair?  Are you\nofficials?  None of you is wearing a uniform, unless what you are\nwearing\" - here he turned towards Franz - \"is meant to be a uniform,\nit's actually more of a travelling suit.  I require a clear answer to\nall these questions, and I'm quite sure that once things have been made\nclear we can take our leave of each other on the best of terms.\"   The\nsupervisor slammed the box of matches down on the table.  \"You're making\na big mistake,\" he said. \"These gentlemen and I have got nothing to do\nwith your business, in fact we know almost nothing about you.  We could\nbe wearing uniforms as proper and exact as you like and your situation\nwouldn't be any the worse for it.  As to whether you're on a charge, I\ncan't give you any sort of clear answer to that, I don't even know\nwhether you are or not.  You're under arrest, you're quite right about\nthat, but I don't know any more than that.  Maybe these officers have\nbeen chit-chatting with you, well if they have that's all it is, chit-\nchat.  I can't give you an answer to your questions, but I can give you\na bit of advice: You'd better think less about us and what's going to\nhappen to you, and think a bit more about yourself.  And stop making all\nthis fuss about your sense of innocence; you don't make such a bad\nimpression, but with all this fuss you're damaging it.  And you ought to\ndo a bit less talking, too.  Almost everything you've said so far has\nbeen things we could have taken from your behaviour, even if you'd said\nno more than a few words.  And what you have said has not exactly been\nin your favour.\"\n\n        K. stared at the supervisor.  Was this man, probably younger than\nhe was, lecturing him like a schoolmaster?  Was he being punished for\nhis honesty with a telling off?  And was he to learn nothing about the\nreasons for his arrest or those who were arresting him?  He became\nsomewhat cross and began to walk up and down.  No-one stopped him doing\nthis and he pushed his sleeves back, felt his chest, straightened his\nhair,  went over to the three men, said, \"It makes no sense,\" at which\nthese three turned round to face him and came towards him with serious\nexpressions.  He finally came again to a halt in front of the\nsupervisor's desk.  \"State Attorney Hasterer is a good friend of mine,\"\nhe said, \"can I telephone him?\"  \"Certainly,\" said the supervisor, \"but\nI don't know what the point of that will be, I suppose you must have\nsome private matter you want to discuss with him.\"  \"What the point is?\"\nshouted K., more disconcerted that cross.   \"Who do you think you are?\nYou want to see some point in it while you're carrying out something as\npointless as it could be?  It's enough to make you cry!  These gentlemen\nfirst accost me, and now they sit or stand about in here and let me be\nhauled up in front of you.  What point there would be, in telephoning a\nstate attorney when I'm ostensibly under arrest?  Very well, I won't\nmake the telephone call.\"  \"You can call him if you want to,\" said the\nsupervisor, stretching his hand out towards the outer room where the\ntelephone was, \"please, go on, do make your phone call.\"  \"No, I don't\nwant to any more,\" said K., and went over to the window.  Across the\nstreet, the people were still there at the window, and it was only now\nthat K. had gone up to his window that they seemed to become uneasy\nabout quietly watching what was going on.  The old couple wanted to get\nup but the man behind them calmed them down.  \"We've got some kind of\naudience over there,\" called K. to the supervisor, quite loudly, as he\npointed out with his forefinger.  \"Go away,\" he then called across to\nthem.  And the three of them did immediately retreat a few steps, the\nold pair even found themselves behind the man who then concealed them\nwith the breadth of his body and seemed, going by the movements of his\nmouth, to be saying something incomprehensible into the distance.  They\ndid not disappear entirely, though, but seemed to be waiting for the\nmoment when they could come back to the window without being noticed.\n\"Intrusive, thoughtless people!\" said K. as he turned back into the\nroom.  The supervisor may have agreed with him, at least K. thought that\nwas what he saw from the corner of his eye.  But it was just as possible\nthat he had not even been listening as he had his hand pressed firmly\ndown on the table and seemed to be comparing the length of his fingers.\nThe two policemen were sitting on a chest covered with a coloured\nblanket, rubbing their knees.  The three young people had put their\nhands on their hips and were looking round aimlessly.  Everything was\nstill, like in some office that has been forgotten about.  \"Now,\ngentlemen,\" called out K., and for a moment it seemed as if he was\ncarrying all of them on his shoulders, \"it looks like your business with\nme is over with.  In my opinion, it's best now to stop wondering about\nwhether you're proceeding correctly or incorrectly, and to bring the\nmatter to a peaceful close with a mutual handshake.  If you are of the\nsame opinion, then please...\" and he walked up to the supervisor's desk\nand held out his hand to him.  The supervisor raised his eyes, bit his\nlip and looked at K.'s outstretched hand; K still believed the\nsupervisor would do as he suggested.  But instead, he stood up, picked\nup a hard round hat that was laying on Miss Buerstner's bed and put it\ncarefully onto his head, using both hands as if trying on a new hat.\n\"Everything seems so simple to you, doesn't it,\" he said to K. as he did\nso, \"so you think we should bring the matter to a peaceful close, do\nyou.  No, no, that won't do.  Mind you, on the other hand I certainly\nwouldn't want you to think there's no hope for you.  No, why should you\nthink that?  You're simply under arrest, nothing more than that.  That's\nwhat I had to tell you, that's what I've done and now I've seen how\nyou've taken it.  That's enough for one day and we can take our leave of\neach other, for the time being at least.  I expect you'll want to go in\nto the bank now, won't you.\"  \"In to the bank?\" asked K., \"I thought I\nwas under arrest.\"   K. said this with a certain amount of defiance as,\nalthough his handshake had not been accepted, he was feeling more\nindependent of all these people, especially since the supervisor had\nstood up.  He was playing with them.  If they left, he had decided he\nwould run after them and offer to let them arrest him.  That's why he\neven repeated, \"How can I go in to the bank when I'm under arrest?\"  \"I\nsee you've misunderstood me,\" said the supervisor who was already at the\ndoor. \"It's true that you're under arrest, but that shouldn't stop you\nfrom carrying out your job.  And there shouldn't be anything to stop you\ncarrying on with your usual life.\"  \"In that case it's not too bad,\nbeing under arrest,\" said K., and went up close to the supervisor.  \"I\nnever meant it should be anything else,\" he replied.  \"It hardly seems\nto have been necessary to notify me of the arrest in that case,\" said K.,\nand went even closer.  The others had also come closer. All of them had\ngathered together into a narrow space by the door.  \"That was my duty,\"\nsaid the supervisor.  \"A silly duty,\" said K., unyielding.  \"Maybe so,\"\nreplied the supervisor, \"only don't let's waste our time talking on like\nthis.  I had assumed you'd be wanting to go to the bank.  As you're\npaying close attention to every word I'll add this: I'm not forcing you\nto go to the bank, I'd just assumed you wanted to.  And to make things\neasier for you, and to let you get to the bank with as little fuss as\npossible I've put these three gentlemen, colleagues of yours, at your\ndisposal.\"  \"What's that?\" exclaimed K., and looked at the three in\nastonishment.  He could only remember seeing them in their group by the\nphotographs, but these characterless, anaemic young people were indeed\nofficials from his bank, not colleagues of his, that was putting it too\nhigh and it showed a gap in the omniscience of the supervisor, but they\nwere nonetheless junior members of staff at the bank.  How could K. have\nfailed to see that?  How occupied he must have been with the supervisor\nand the policemen not to have recognised these three!  Rabensteiner,\nwith his stiff demeanour and swinging hands, Kullich, with his blonde\nhair and deep-set eyes, and Kaminer, with his involuntary grin caused by\nchronic muscle spasms.  \"Good morning,\" said K. after a while, extending\nhis hand to the gentlemen as they bowed correctly to him.  \"I didn't\nrecognise you at all.  So, we'll go into work now, shall we?\"  The\ngentlemen laughed and nodded enthusiastically, as if that was what they\nhad been waiting for all the time, except that K. had left his hat in\nhis room so they all dashed, one after another, into the room to fetch\nit, which caused a certain amount of embarrassment.  K. stood where he\nwas and watched them through the open double doorway, the last to go, of\ncourse, was the apathetic Rabensteiner who had broken into no more than\nan elegant trot.  Kaminer got to the hat and K., as he often had to do\nat the bank, forcibly reminded himself that the grin was not deliberate,\nthat he in fact wasn't able to grin deliberately.  At that moment Mrs.\nGrubach opened the door from the hallway into the living room where all\nthe people were.  She did not seem to feel guilty about anything at all,\nand K., as often before, looked down at the belt of her apron which, for\nno reason, cut so deeply into her hefty body.  Once downstairs, K., with\nhis watch in his hand, decided to take a taxi - he had already been\ndelayed by half an hour and there was no need to make the delay any\nlonger.  Kaminer ran to the corner to summon it, and the two others were\nmaking obvious efforts to keep K. diverted when Kullich pointed to the\ndoorway of the house on the other side of the street where the large man\nwith the blonde goatee beard appeared and, a little embarrassed at first\nat letting himself be seen in his full height, stepped back to the wall\nand leant against it.  The old couple were probably still on the stairs.\nK. was cross with Kullich for pointing out this man whom he had already\nseen himself, in fact whom he had been expecting. \"Don't look at him!\"\nhe snapped, without noticing how odd it was to speak to free men in this\nway.  But there was no explanation needed anyway as just then the taxi\narrived, they sat inside and set off.  Inside the taxi, K. remembered\nthat he had not noticed the supervisor and the policemen leaving - the\nsupervisor had stopped him noticing the three bank staff and now the\nthree bank staff had stopped him noticing the supervisor.  This showed\nthat K. was not very attentive, and he resolved to watch himself more\ncarefully in this respect.  Nonetheless, he gave it no thought as he\ntwisted himself round and leant over onto the rear shelf of the car to\ncatch sight of the supervisor and the policemen if he could.  But he\nturned back round straight away and leant comfortably into the corner of\nthe taxi without even having made the effort to see anyone.  Although it\ndid not seem like it, now was just the time when he needed some\nencouragement, but the gentlemen seemed tired just then, Rabensteiner\nlooked out of the car to the right, Kullich to the left and only Kaminer\nwas there with his grin at K.'s service.  It would have been inhumane to\nmake fun of that.\n\n        That spring, whenever possible, K. usually spent his evenings\nafter work - he usually stayed in the office until nine o'clock - with a\nshort walk, either by himself or in the company of some of the bank\nofficials, and then he would go into a pub where he would sit at the\nregulars' table with mostly older men until eleven.  There were,\nhowever, also exceptions to this habit, times, for instance, when K. was\ninvited by the bank's manager (whom he greatly respected for his\nindustry and trustworthiness) to go with him for a ride in his car or to\neat dinner with him at his large house.  K. would also go, once a week,\nto see a girl called Elsa who worked as a waitress in a wine bar through\nthe night until late in the morning.  During the daytime she only\nreceived visitors while still in bed.\n\n        That evening, though, - the day had passed quickly with a lot of\nhard work and many respectful and friendly birthday greetings - K.\nwanted to go straight home.  Each time he had any small break from the\nday's work he considered, without knowing exactly what he had in mind,\nthat Mrs. Grubach's flat seemed to have been put into great disarray by\nthe events of that morning, and that it was up to him to put it back\ninto order.  Once order had been restored, every trace of those events\nwould have been erased and everything would take its previous course\nonce more.  In particular, there was nothing to fear from the three bank\nofficials, they had immersed themselves back into their paperwork and\nthere was no alteration to be seen in them.  K. had called each of them,\nseparately or all together, into his office that day for no other reason\nthan to observe them; he was always satisfied and had always been able\nto let them go again.\n\n        At half past nine that evening, when he arrived back in front of\nthe building where he lived, he met a young lad in the doorway who was\nstanding there, his legs apart and smoking a pipe.  \"Who are you?\"\nimmediately asked K., bringing his face close to the lad's, as it was\nhard to see in the half light of the landing.  \"I'm the landlord's son,\nsir,\" answered the lad, taking the pipe from his mouth and stepping to\none side.  \"The landlord's son?\" asked K., and impatiently knocked on\nthe ground with his stick.  \"Did you want anything, sir?  Would you like\nme to fetch my father?\"  \"No, no,\" said K., there was something\nforgiving in his voice, as if the boy had harmed him in some way and he\nwas excusing him.  \"It's alright,\" he said then, and went on, but before\ngoing up the stairs he turned round once more.\n\n        He could have gone directly to his room, but as he wanted to speak\nwith Mrs. Grubach he went straight to her door and knocked.  She was sat\nat the table with a knitted stocking and a pile of old stockings in\nfront of her.  K. apologised, a little embarrassed at coming so late,\nbut Mrs. Grubach was very friendly and did not want to hear any apology,\nshe was always ready to speak to him, he knew very well that he was her\nbest and her favourite tenant.  K. looked round the room, it looked\nexactly as it usually did, the breakfast dishes, which had been on the\ntable by the window that morning, had already been cleared away.  \"A\nwoman's hands will do many things when no-one's looking,\" he thought, he\nmight himself have smashed all the dishes on the spot but certainly\nwould not have been able to carry it all out.  He looked at Mrs. Grubach\nwith some gratitude.  \"Why are you working so late?\" he asked.  They\nwere now both sitting at the table, and K. now and then sank his hands\ninto the pile of stockings.  \"There's a lot of work to do,\" she said,\n\"during the day I belong to the tenants; if I'm to sort out my own\nthings there are only the evenings left to me.\"  \"I fear I may have\ncaused you some exceptional work today.\"  \"How do you mean, Mr. K.?\" she\nasked, becoming more interested and leaving her work in her lap.  \"I\nmean the men who were here this morning.\"  \"Oh, I see,\" she said, and\nwent peacefully back to what she was doing, \"that was no trouble, not\nespecially.\"  K. looked on in silence as she took up the knitted\nstocking once more.  She seems surprised at my mentioning it, he\nthought, she seems to think it's improper for me to mention it.  All the\nmore important for me to do so.  An old woman is the only person I can\nspeak about it with.  \"But it must have caused some work for you,\" he\nsaid then, \"but it won't happen again.\" \"No, it can't happen again,\" she\nagreed, and smiled at K. in a way that was almost pained.  \"Do you mean\nthat seriously?\" asked K.  \"Yes,\" she said, more gently, \"but the\nimportant thing is you mustn't take it too hard.  There are so many\nawful things happening in the world!  As you're being so honest with me,\nMr. K., I can admit to you that I listened to a little of what was going\non from behind the door, and that those two policemen told me one or two\nthings as well.  It's all to do with your happiness, and that's\nsomething that's quite close to my heart, perhaps more than it should be\nas I am, after all, only your landlady. Anyway, so I heard one or two\nthings but I can't really say that it's about anything very serious.\nNo.  You have been arrested, but it's not in the same way as when they\narrest a thief.  If you're arrested in the same way as a thief, then\nit's bad, but an arrest like this ... .  It seems to me that it's\nsomething very complicated - forgive me if I'm saying something stupid -\nsomething very complicated that I don't understand, but something that\nyou don't really need to understand anyway.\"\n\n        \"There's nothing stupid about what you've said, Mrs. Grubach, or\nat least I partly agree with you, only, the way I judge the whole thing\nis harsher than yours, and think it's not only not something complicated\nbut simply a fuss about nothing.  I was just caught unawares, that's\nwhat happened.  If I had got up as soon as I was awake without letting\nmyself get confused because Anna wasn't there, if I'd got up and paid no\nregard to anyone who might have been in my way and come straight to you,\nif I'd done something like having my breakfast in the kitchen as an\nexception, asked you to bring my clothes from my room, in short, if I\nhad behaved sensibly then nothing more would have happened, everything\nthat was waiting to happen would have been stifled.  People are so often\nunprepared.  In the bank, for example, I am well prepared, nothing of\nthis sort could possibly happen to me there, I have my own assistant\nthere, there are telephones for internal and external calls in front of\nme on the desk, I continually receive visits from people,\nrepresentatives, officials, but besides that, and most importantly, I'm\nalways occupied with my work, that's to say I'm always alert, it would\neven be a pleasure for me to find myself faced with something of that\nsort.  But now it's over with, and I didn't really even want to talk\nabout it any more, only I wanted to hear what you, as a sensible woman,\nthought about it all, and I'm very glad to hear that we're in agreement.\nBut now you must give me your hand, an agreement of this sort needs to\nbe confirmed with a handshake.\"\n\n        Will she shake hands with me?  The supervisor didn't shake hands,\nhe thought, and looked at the woman differently from before, examining\nher.  She stood up, as he had also stood up, and was a little self-\nconscious, she hadn't been able to understand everything that K.\nsaid.  As a result of this self consciousness she said something that\nshe certainly did not intend and certainly was not appropriate.  \"Don't\ntake it so hard, Mr. K.,\" she said, with tears in her voice and also, of\ncourse, forgetting the handshake.  \"I didn't know I was taking it hard,\"\nsaid K., feeling suddenly tired and seeing that if this woman did agree\nwith him it was of very little value.\n\n        Before going out the door he asked, \"Is Miss Buerstner home?\"\n\"No,\" said Mrs. Grubach, smiling as she gave this simple piece of\ninformation, saying something sensible at last.  \"She's at the theatre.\nDid you want to see her?  Should I give her a message?\"  \"I, er, I just\nwanted to have a few words with her.\"  \"I'm afraid I don't know when\nshe's coming in; she usually gets back late when she's been to the\ntheatre.\"  \"It really doesn't matter,\" said K. his head hanging as he\nturned to the door to leave, \"I just wanted to give her my apology for\ntaking over her room today.\"  \"There's no need for that, Mr. K., you're\ntoo conscientious, the young lady doesn't know anything about it, she\nhasn't been home since early this morning and everything's been tidied\nup again, you can see for yourself.\"  And she opened the door to Miss\nBuerstner's room.  \"Thank you, I'll take your word for it,\" said K, but\nwent nonetheless over to the open door.  The moon shone quietly into the\nunlit room.  As far as could be seen, everything was indeed in its\nplace, not even the blouse was hanging on the window handle.  The\npillows on the bed looked remarkably plump as they lay half in the\nmoonlight.  \"Miss Buerstner often comes home late,\" said K., looking at\nMrs. Grubach as if that were her responsibility.  \"That's how young\npeople are!\" said Mrs. Grubach to excuse herself.  \"Of course, of\ncourse,\" said K., \"but it can be taken too far.\"  \"Yes, it can be,\" said\nMrs. Grubach, \"you're so right, Mr. K.  Perhaps it is in this case.  I\ncertainly wouldn't want to say anything nasty about Miss Buerstner, she\nis a good, sweet girl, friendly, tidy, punctual, works hard, I\nappreciate all that very much, but one thing is true, she ought to have\nmore pride, be a bit less forthcoming.  Twice this month already, in the\nstreet over the way, I've seen her with a different gentleman.  I really\ndon't like saying this, you're the only one I've said this to, Mr. K., I\nswear to God, but I'm going to have no choice but to have a few words\nwith Miss Buerstner about it myself.  And it's not the only thing about\nher that I'm worried about.\"  \"Mrs. Grubach, you are on quite the wrong\ntrack,\" said K., so angry that he was hardly able to hide it, \"and you\nhave moreover misunderstood what I was saying about Miss Buerstner, that\nis not what I meant.  In fact I warn you quite directly not to say\nanything to her, you are quite mistaken, I know Miss Buerstner very well\nand there is no truth at all in what you say.  And what's more, perhaps\nI'm going to far, I don't want to get in your way, say to her whatever\nyou see fit.  Good night.\"  \"Mr. K.,\" said Mrs. Grubach as if asking him\nfor something and hurrying to his door which he had already opened, \"I\ndon't want to speak to Miss Buerstner at all, not yet, of course I'll\ncontinue to keep an eye on her but you're the only one I've told what I\nknow.  And it is, after all something that everyone who lets rooms has\nto do if she's to keep the house decent, that's all I'm trying to do.\"\n\"Decent!\" called out K. through the crack in the door, \"if you want to\nkeep the house decent you'll first have to give me notice.\"  Then he\nslammed the door shut, there was a gentle knocking to which he paid no\nmore attention.\n\n        He did not feel at all like going to bed, so he decided to stay\nup, and this would also give him the chance to find out when Miss\nBuerstner would arrive home.  Perhaps it would also still be possible,\neven if a little inappropriate, to have a few words with her.  As he lay\nthere by the window, pressing his hands to his tired eyes, he even\nthought for a moment that he might punish Mrs. Grubach by persuading\nMiss Buerstner to give in her notice at the same time as he would.  But\nhe immediately realised that that would be shockingly excessive, and\nthere would even be the suspicion that he was moving house because of\nthe incidents of that morning.  Nothing would have been more nonsensical\nand, above all, more pointless and contemptible.\n\n        When he had become tired of looking out onto the empty street he\nslightly opened the door to the living room so that he could see anyone\nwho entered the flat from where he was and lay down on the couch.  He\nlay there, quietly smoking a cigar, until about eleven o'clock.  He\nwasn't able to hold out longer than that, and went a little way into the\nhallway as if in that way he could make Miss Buerstner arrive sooner.  He\nhad no particular desire for her, he could not even remember what she\nlooked like, but now he wanted to speak to her and it irritated him that\nher late arrival home meant this day would be full of unease and\ndisorder right to its very end.  It was also her fault that he had not\nhad any dinner that evening and that he had been unable to visit Elsa as\nhe had intended.  He could still make up for both of those things,\nthough, if he went to the wine bar where Elsa worked.  He wanted to do\nso even later, after the discussion with Miss Buerstner.\n\n        It was already gone half past eleven when someone could be heard\nin the stairway.  K., who had been lost in his thoughts in the hallway,\nwalking up and down loudly as if it were his own room, fled behind his\ndoor.  Miss Buerstner had arrived.  Shivering, she pulled a silk shawl\nover her slender shoulders as she locked the door.  The next moment she\nwould certainly go into her room, where K. ought not to intrude in the\nmiddle of the night; that meant he would have to speak to her now, but,\nunfortunately, he had not put the electric light on in his room so that\nwhen he stepped out of the dark it would give the impression of being an\nattack and would certainly, at the very least, have been quite alarming.\nThere was no time to lose, and in his helplessness he whispered through\nthe crack of the door, \"Miss Buerstner.\"  It sounded like he was pleading\nwith her, not calling to her.  \"Is there someone there?\" asked Miss\nBuerstner, looking round with her eyes wide open.  \"It's me,\" said K. and\ncame out.  \"Oh, Mr. K.!\" said Miss Buerstner with a smile. \"Good\nEvening,\" and offered him her hand.  \"I wanted to have a word with you,\nif you would allow me?\"  \"Now?\" asked Miss Buerstner, \"does it have to be\nnow? It is a little odd, isn't it?\"  \"I've been waiting for you since\nnine o'clock.\"  \"Well, I was at the theatre, I didn't know anything\nabout you waiting for me.\"  \"The reason I need to speak to you only came\nup today\"  \"I see, well I don't see why not, I suppose, apart from being\nso tired I could drop.  Come into my room for a few minutes then.  We\ncertainly can't talk out here, we'd wake everyone up and I think that\nwould be more unpleasant for us than for them.  Wait here till I've put\nthe light on in my room, and then turn the light down out here.\"  K. did\nas he was told, and then even waited until Miss Buerstner came out of her\nroom and quietly invited him, once more, to come in.  \"Sit down,\" she\nsaid, indicating the ottoman, while she herself remained standing by the\nbedpost despite the tiredness she had spoken of; she did not even take\noff her hat, which was small but decorated with an abundance of flowers.\n\"What is it you wanted, then?  I'm really quite curious.\"  She gently\ncrossed her legs.\n\"I expect you'll say,\" K. began, \"that the matter really isn't all that\nurgent and we don't need to talk about it right now, but ...\"  \"I never\nlisten to introductions,\" said Miss Buerstner.  \"That makes my job so\nmuch easier,\" said K.  \"This morning, to some extent through my fault,\nyour room was made a little untidy, this happened because of people I\ndid not know and against my will but, as I said, because of my fault; I\nwanted to apologise for it.\"  \"My room?\" asked Miss Buerstner, and\ninstead of looking round the room scrutinised K.  \"It is true,\" said K.,\nand now, for the first time, they looked each other in the eyes,\n\"there's no point in saying exactly how this came about.\"  \"But that's\nthe interesting thing about it,\" said Miss Buerstner.  \"No,\" said K.\n\"Well then,\" said Miss Buerstner, \"I don't want to force my way into any\nsecrets, if you insist that it's of no interest I won't insist.  I'm\nquite happy to forgive you for it, as you ask, especially as I can't see\nanything at all that's been left untidy.\"  With her hand laid flat on\nher lower hip, she made a tour around the room.  At the mat where the\nphotographs were she stopped.  \"Look at this!\" she cried.  \"My\nphotographs really have been put in the wrong places.  Oh, that's\nhorrible.  Someone really has been in my room without permission.\"  K.\nnodded, and quietly cursed Kaminer who worked at his bank and who was\nalways active doing things that had neither use nor purpose.  \"It is\nodd,\" said Miss Buerstner, \"that I'm forced to forbid you to do something\nthat you ought to have forbidden yourself to do, namely to come into my\nroom when I'm not here.\"  \"But I did explain to you,\" said K., and went\nover to join her by the photographs, \"that it wasn't me who interfered\nwith your photographs; but as you don't believe me I'll have to admit\nthat the investigating committee brought along three bank employees with\nthem, one of them must have touched your photographs and as soon as I\nget the chance I'll ask to have him dismissed from the bank.  Yes, there\nwas an investigating committee here,\" added K., as the young lady was\nlooking at him enquiringly.  \"Because of you?\" she asked.  \"Yes,\"\nanswered K.  \"No!\" the lady cried with a laugh.  \"Yes, they were,\" said\nK., \"you believe that I'm innocent then, do you?\"  \"Well now, innocent\n...\" said the lady, \"I don't want to start making any pronouncements\nthat might have serious consequences, I don't really know you after all,\nit means they're dealing with a serious criminal if they send an\ninvestigating committee straight out to get him.  But you're not in\ncustody now - at least I take it you've not escaped from prison\nconsidering that you seem quite calm - so you can't have committed any\ncrime of that sort.\"  \"Yes,\" said K., \"but it might be that the\ninvestigating committee could see that I'm innocent, or not so guilty as\nhad been supposed.\"  \"Yes, that's certainly a possibility,\" said Miss\nBuerstner, who seemed very interested.  \"Listen,\" said K., \"you don't\nhave much experience in legal matters.\"  \"No, that's true, I don't,\"\nsaid Miss Buerstner, \"and I've often regretted it, as I'd like to know\neverything and I'm very interested in legal matters.  There's something\npeculiarly attractive about the law, isn't there?  But I'll certainly be\nperfecting my knowledge in this area, as next month I start work in a\nlegal office.\"  \"That's very good,\" said K., \"that means you'll be able\nto give me some help with my trial.\"  \"That could well be,\" said Miss\nBuerstner, \"why not?  I like to make use of what I know.\"  \"I mean it\nquite seriously,\" said K., \"or at least, half seriously, as you do.\nThis affair is too petty to call in a lawyer, but I could make good use\nof someone who could give me advice.\"  \"Yes, but if I'm to give you\nadvice I'll have to know what it's all about,\" said Miss Buerstner.\n\"That's exactly the problem,\" said K., \"I don't know that myself.\"  \"So\nyou have been making fun of me, then,\" said Miss Buerstner exceedingly\ndisappointed, \"you really ought not to try something like that on at\nthis time of night.\"  And she stepped away from the photographs where\nthey had stood so long together.  \"Miss Buerstner, no,\" said K., \"I'm not\nmaking fun of you.  Please believe me!  I've already told you everything\nI know.  More than I know, in fact, as it actually wasn't even an\ninvestigating committee, that's just what I called them because I don't\nknow what else to call them.  There was no cross questioning at all, I\nwas merely arrested, but by a committee.\"  Miss Buerstner sat on the\nottoman and laughed again.  \"What was it like then?\" she asked.  \"It was\nterrible\" said K., although his mind was no longer on the subject, he\nhad become totally absorbed by Miss Buerstner's gaze who was supporting\nher chin on one hand - the elbow rested on the cushion of the ottoman -\nand slowly stroking her hip with the other.  \"That's too vague,\" said\nMiss Buerstner.  \"What's too vague?\" asked K.  Then he remembered himself\nand asked, \"Would you like me to show you what it was like?\"  He wanted\nto move in some way but did not want to leave.  \"I'm already tired,\"\nsaid Miss Buerstner.  \"You arrived back so late,\" said K.  \"Now you've\nstarted telling me off.  Well I suppose I deserve it as I shouldn't have\nlet you in here in the first place, and it turns out there wasn't even\nany point.\"  \"Oh, there was a point, you'll see now how important a\npoint it was,\" said K.  \"May I move this table away from your bedside\nand put it here?\"  \"What do you think you're doing?\" said Miss Buerstner.\n\"Of course you can't!\"  \"In that case I can't show you,\" said K., quite\nupset, as if Miss Buerstner had committed some incomprehensible offence\nagainst him.  \"Alright then, if you need it to show what you mean, just\ntake the bedside table then,\" said Miss Buerstner, and after a short\npause added in a weak voice,  \"I'm so tired I'm allowing more than I\nought to.\"  K. put the little table in the middle of the room and sat\ndown behind it.  \"You have to get a proper idea of where the people were\nsituated, it is very interesting.  I'm the supervisor, sitting over\nthere on the chest are two policemen, standing next to the photographs\nthere are three young people.  Hanging on the handle of the window is a\nwhite blouse - I just mention that by the way.  And now it begins.  Ah\nyes, I'm forgetting myself, the most important person of all, so I'm\nstanding here in front of the table.  The supervisor is sitting\nextremely comfortably with his legs crossed and his arm hanging over the\nbackrest here like some layabout.  And now it really does begin.  The\nsupervisor calls out as if he had to wake me up, in fact he shouts at\nme, I'm afraid, if I'm to make it clear to you, I'll have to shout as\nwell, and it's nothing more than my name that he shouts out.\"  Miss\nBuerstner, laughing as she listened to him, laid her forefinger on her\nmouth so that K. would not shout, but it was too late.  K. was too\nengrossed in his role and slowly called out, \"Josef K.!\".  It was not as\nloud as he had threatened, but nonetheless, once he had suddenly called\nit out, the cry seemed gradually to spread itself all round the room.\n\n        There was a series of loud, curt and regular knocks at the door of\nthe adjoining room.  Miss Buerstner went pale and laid her hand on her\nheart.  K. was especially startled, as for a moment he had been quite\nunable to think of anything other than the events of that morning and\nthe girl for whom he was performing them.  He had hardly pulled himself\ntogether when he jumped over to Miss Buerstner and took her hand.  \"Don't\nbe afraid,\" he whispered, \"I'll put everything right.  But who can it\nbe?  It's only the living room next door, nobody sleeps in there.\"  \"Yes\nthey do,\" whispered Miss Buerstner into K.'s ear, \"a nephew of Mrs.\nGrubach's, an captain in the army, has been sleeping there since\nyesterday.  There's no other room free.  I'd forgotten about it too.\nWhy did you have to shout like that?  You've made me quite upset.\"\n\"There is no reason for it,\" said K., and, now as she sank back onto the\ncushion, kissed her forehead.  \"Go away, go away,\" she said, hurriedly\nsitting back up, \"get out of here, go, what is it you want, he's\nlistening at the door he can hear everything.  You're causing me so much\ntrouble!\"  \"I won't go,\" said K., \"until you've calmed down a bit.  Come\nover into the other corner of the room, he won't be able to hear us\nthere.\"  She let him lead her there. \"Don't forget,\" he said, \"although\nthis might be unpleasant for you you're not in any real danger.  You\nknow how much esteem Mrs. Grubach has for  me, she's the one who will\nmake all the decisions in this, especially as the captain is her nephew,\nbut she believes everything I say without question.  What's more, she\nhas borrowed a large sum of money from me and that makes her dependent\non me.  I will confirm whatever you say to explain our being here\ntogether, however inappropriate it might be, and I guarantee to make\nsure that Mrs. Grubach will not only say she believes the explanation in\npublic but will believe it truly and sincerely.  You will have no need\nto consider me in any way.  If you wish to let it be known that I have\nattacked you then Mrs. Grubach will be informed of such and she will\nbelieve it without even losing her trust in me, that's how much respect\nshe has for me.\"  Miss Buerstner looked at the floor in front of her,\nquiet and a little sunk in on herself.  \"Why would Mrs. Grubach not\nbelieve that I've attacked you?\" added K. He looked at her hair in front\nof him, parted, bunched down, reddish and firmly held in place.  He\nthought she would look up at him, but without changing her manner she\nsaid, \"Forgive me, but it was the suddenness of the knocking that\nstartled me so much, not so much what the consequences of the captain\nbeing here might be.  It was all so quiet after you'd shouted, and then\nthere was the knocking, that's was made me so shocked, and I was sitting\nright by the door, the knocking was right next to me.  Thank you for\nyour suggestions, but I won't accept them.  I can bear the\nresponsibility for anything that happens in my room myself, and I can do\nso with anyone.  I'm surprised you don't realise just how insulting your\nsuggestions are and what they imply about me, although I certainly\nacknowledge your good intentions.  But now, please go, leave me alone, I\nneed you to go now even more than I did earlier.  The couple of minutes\nyou asked for have grown into half an hour, more than half an hour now.\"\nK. took hold of her hand, and then of her wrist, \"You're not cross with\nme, though?\" he said.  She pulled her hand away and answered, \"No, no,\nI'm never cross with anyone.\"  He grasped her wrist once more, she\ntolerated it now and, in that way, lead him to the door.  He had fully\nintended to leave.  But when he reached the door he came to a halt as if\nhe hadn't expected to find a door there, Miss Buerstner made use of that\nmoment to get herself free, open the door, slip out into the hallway and\ngently say to K. from there, \"Now, come along, please.  Look,\" she\npointed to the captain's door, from under which there was a light\nshining, \"he's put a light on and he's laughing at us.\"  \"Alright, I'm\ncoming,\" said K., moved forward, took hold of her, kissed her on the\nmouth and then over her whole face like a thirsty animal lapping with\nits tongue when it eventually finds water.  He finally kissed her on her\nneck and her throat and left his lips pressed there for a long time.  He\ndid not look up until there was a noise from the captain's room.  \"I'll\ngo now,\" he said, he wanted to address Miss Buerstner by her Christian\nname, but did not know it.  She gave him a tired nod, offered him her\nhand to kiss as she turned away as if she did not know what she was\ndoing, and went back into her room with her head bowed.  A short while\nlater, K. was lying in his bed. He very soon went to sleep, but before\nhe did he thought a little while about his behaviour, he was satisfied\nwith it but felt some surprise that he was not more satisfied; he was\nseriously worried about Miss Buerstner because of the captain.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Two\nFirst Cross-examination\n\n        K. was informed by telephone that there would be a small hearing\nconcerning his case the following Sunday. He was made aware that these\ncross examinations would follow one another regularly, perhaps not every\nweek but quite frequently. On the one hand it was in everyone's interest\nto bring proceedings quickly to their conclusion, but on the other hand\nevery aspect of the examinations had to be carried out thoroughly\nwithout lasting too long because of the associated stress.  For these\nreasons, it had been decided to hold a series of brief examinations\nfollowing on one after another.  Sunday had been chosen as the day for\nthe hearings so that K. would not be disturbed in his professional work.\nIt was assumed that he would be in agreement with this, but if he wished\nfor another date then, as far as possible, he would be accommodated.\nCross-examinations could even be held in the night, for instance, but K.\nwould probably not be fresh enough at that time.  Anyway, as long as K.\nmade no objection, the hearing would be left on Sundays.  It was a\nmatter of course that he would have to appear without fail, there was\nprobably no need to point this out to him.  He would be given the number\nof the building where he was to present himself, which was in a street\nin a suburb well away from the city centre which K. had never been to\nbefore.\n\n        Once he had received this notice, K. hung up the receiver without\ngiving an answer; he had decided immediately to go there that Sunday, it\nwas certainly necessary, proceedings had begun and he had to face up to\nit, and this first examination would probably also be the last.  He was\nstill standing in thought by the telephone when he heard the voice of\nthe deputy director behind him - he wanted to use the telephone but K.\nstood in his way.  \"Bad news?\" asked the deputy director casually, not\nin order to find anything out but just to get K. away from the device.\n\"No, no,\" said K., he stepped to one side but did not go away entirely.\nThe deputy director picked up the receiver and, as he waited for his\nconnection, turned away from it and said to K.,  \"One question, Mr. K.:\nWould you like to give me the pleasure of joining me on my sailing boat\non Sunday morning?  There's quite a few people coming, you're bound to\nknow some of them.  One of them is Hasterer, the state attorney.  Would\nyou like to come along?  Do come along!\"  K. tried to pay attention to\nwhat the deputy director was saying.  It was of no small importance for\nhim, as this invitation from the deputy director, with whom he had never\ngot on very well, meant that he was trying to improve his relations with\nhim.  It showed how important K. had become in the bank and how its\nsecond most important official seemed to value his friendship, or at\nleast his impartiality.  He was only speaking at the side of the\ntelephone receiver while he waited for his connection, but in giving\nthis invitation the deputy director was humbling himself.  But K. would\nhave to humiliate him a second time as a result, he said, \"Thank you\nvery much, but I'm afraid I will have no time on Sunday, I have a\nprevious obligation.\"  \"Pity,\" said the deputy director, and turned to\nthe telephone conversation that had just been connected.  It was not a\nshort conversation, but K., remained standing confused by the instrument\nall the time it was going on.  It was only when the deputy director hung\nup that he was shocked into awareness and said, in order to partially\nexcuse his standing there for no reason, \"I've just received a telephone\ncall, there's somewhere I need to go, but they forgot to tell me what\ntime.\"  \"Ask them then,\" said the deputy director.  \"It's not that\nimportant,\" said K., although in that way his earlier excuse, already\nweak enough, was made even weaker.  As he went, the deputy director\ncontinued to speak about other things.  K. forced himself to answer, but\nhis thoughts were mainly about that Sunday, how it would be best to get\nthere for nine o'clock in the morning as that was the time that courts\nalways start work on weekdays.\n\n        The weather was dull on Sunday.  K. was very tired, as he had\nstayed out drinking until late in the night celebrating with some of the\nregulars, and he had almost overslept.  He dressed hurriedly, without\nthe time to think and assemble the various plans he had worked out\nduring the week.  With no breakfast, he rushed to the suburb he had been\ntold about.  Oddly enough, although he had little time to look around\nhim, he came across the three bank officials involved in his case,\nRabensteiner, Kullich and Kaminer.  The first two were travelling in a\ntram that went across K.'s route, but Kaminer sat on the terrace of a\ncafe and leant curiously over the wall as K. came over.  All of them\nseemed to be looking at him, surprised at seeing their superior running;\nit was  a kind of pride that made K. want to go on foot, this was his\naffair and the idea of any help from strangers, however slight, was\nrepulsive to him, he also wanted to avoid asking for anyone's help\nbecause that would initiate them into the affair even if only slightly.\nAnd after all, he had no wish at all to humiliate himself before the\ncommittee by being too punctual.  Anyway, now he was running so that he\nwould get there by nine o'clock if at all possible, even though he had\nno appointment for this time.\n\n        He had thought that he would recognise the building from a\ndistance by some kind of sign, without knowing exactly what the sign\nwould look like, or from some particular kind of activity outside the\nentrance.  K. had been told that the building was in Juliusstrasse, but\nwhen he stood at the street's entrance it consisted on each side of\nalmost nothing but monotonous, grey constructions, tall blocks of flats\noccupied by poor people.  Now, on  a Sunday morning, most of the windows\nwere occupied, men in their shirtsleeves leant out smoking, or carefully\nand gently held small children on the sills.  Other windows were piled\nup with bedding, above which the dishevelled head of a woman would\nbriefly appear.  People called out to each other across the street, one\nof the calls provoked a loud laugh about K. himself.  It was a long\nstreet, and spaced evenly along it were small shops below street level,\nselling various kinds of foodstuffs, which you reached by going down a\nfew steps.  Women went in and out of them or stood chatting on the\nsteps.  A fruitmonger, taking his goods up to the windows, was just as\ninattentive as K. and nearly knocked him down with his cart.  Just then,\na gramophone, which in better parts of town would have been seen as worn\nout, began to play some murderous tune.\n\n        K. went further into the street, slowly, as if he had plenty of\ntime now, or as if the examining magistrate were looking at him from one\nof the windows and therefore knew that K. had found his way there.  It\nwas shortly after nine.  The building was quite far down the street, it\ncovered so much area it was almost extraordinary, and the gateway in\nparticular was tall and long.  It was clearly intended for delivery\nwagons belonging to the various warehouses all round the yard which were\nnow locked up and carried the names of companies some of which K. knew\nfrom his work at the bank.  In contrast with his usual habits, he\nremained standing a while at the entrance to the yard taking in all\nthese external details.  Near him, there was a bare-footed man sitting\non a crate and reading a newspaper.  There were two lads swinging on a\nhand cart.  In front of a pump stood a weak, young girl in a bedjacket\nwho, as the water flowed into her can, looked at K.  There was a piece\nof rope stretched between two windows in a corner of the yard, with some\nwashing hanging on it to dry.  A man stood below it calling out\ninstructions to direct the work being done.\n\n        K. went over to the stairway to get to the room where the hearing\nwas to take place, but then stood still again as besides these steps he\ncould see three other stairway entrances, and there also seemed to be a\nsmall passageway at the end of the yard leading into a second yard.  It\nirritated him that he had not been given more precise directions to the\nroom, it meant they were either being especially neglectful with him or\nespecially indifferent, and he decided to make that clear to them very\nloudly and very unambiguously.  In the end he decided to climb up the\nstairs, his thoughts playing on something that he remembered the\npoliceman, Willem, saying to him; that the court is attracted by the\nguilt, from which it followed that the courtroom must be on the stairway\nthat K. selected by chance.\n\n        As he went up he disturbed a large group of children playing on\nthe stairs who looked at him as he stepped through their rows.  \"Next\ntime I come here,\" he said to himself, \"I must either bring sweets with\nme to make them like me or a stick to hit them with.\"  Just before he\nreached the first landing he even had to wait a little while until a\nball had finished its movement, two small lads with sly faces like\ngrown-up scoundrels held him by his trouser-legs until it had; if he\nwere to shake them off he would have to hurt them, and he was afraid of\nwhat noise they would make by shouting.\n\n        On the first floor, his search began for real.  He still felt\nunable to ask for the investigating committee, and so he invented a\njoiner called Lanz - that name occurred to him because the captain, Mrs.\nGrubach's nephew, was called Lanz - so that he could ask at every flat\nwhether Lanz the joiner lived there and thus obtain a chance to look\ninto the rooms.  It turned out, though, that that was mostly possible\nwithout further ado, as almost all the doors were left open and the\nchildren ran in and out.  Most of them were small, one-windowed rooms\nwhere they also did the cooking.  Many women held babies in one arm and\nworked at the stove with the other.   Half grown girls, who seemed to be\ndressed in just their pinafores worked hardest running to and fro.  In\nevery room, the beds were still in use by people who were ill, or still\nasleep, or people stretched out on them in their clothes.  K. knocked at\nthe flats where the doors were closed and asked whether Lanz the joiner\nlived there.   It was usually a woman who opened the door, heard the\nenquiry and turned to somebody in the room who would raise himself from\nthe bed.  \"The gentleman's asking if a joiner called Lanz, lives here.\"\n\"A joiner, called Lanz?\" he would ask from the bed.\"  \"That's right,\" K.\nwould say, although it was clear that the investigating committee was\nnot to be found there, and so his task was at an end.  There were many\nwho thought it must be very important for K. to find Lanz the joiner and\nthought long about it, naming a joiner who was not called Lanz or giving\na name that had some vague similarity with Lanz, or they asked\nneighbours or accompanied K. to a door a long way away where they\nthought someone of that sort might live in the back part of the building\nor where someone would be who could advise K. better than they could\nthemselves.  K. eventually had to give up asking if he did not want to\nbe led all round from floor to floor in this way.  He regretted his\ninitial plan, which had at first seemed so practical to him.  As he\nreached the fifth floor, he decided to give up the search, took his\nleave of a friendly, young worker who wanted to lead him on still\nfurther and went down the stairs.  But then the thought of how much time\nhe was wasting made him cross, he went back again and knocked at the\nfirst door on the fifth floor.  The first thing he saw in the small room\nwas a large clock on the wall which already showed ten o'clock.  \"Is\nthere a joiner called Lanz who lives here?\" he asked.  \"Pardon?\" said a\nyoung woman with black, shining eyes who was, at that moment, washing\nchildren's underclothes in a bucket.  She pointed her wet hand towards\nthe open door of the adjoining room.\n\n        K. thought he had stepped into a meeting.  A medium sized, two\nwindowed room was filled with the most diverse crowd of people - nobody\npaid any attention to the person who had just entered.  Close under its\nceiling it was surrounded by a gallery which was also fully occupied and\nwhere the people could only stand bent down with their heads and their\nbacks touching the ceiling.  K., who found the air too stuffy, stepped\nout again and said to the young woman, who had probably misunderstood\nwhat he had said, \"I asked for a joiner, someone by the name of Lanz.\"\n\"Yes,\" said the woman, \"please go on in.\"  K. would probably not have\nfollowed her if the woman had not gone up to him, taken hold of the door\nhandle and said, \"I'll have to close the door after you, no-one else\nwill be allowed in.\"  \"Very sensible,\" said K., \"but it's too full\nalready.\"  But then he went back in anyway.  He passed through between\ntwo men who were talking beside the door - one of them held both hands\nfar out in front of himself making the movements of counting out money,\nthe other looked him closely in the eyes - and someone took him by the\nhand.  It was a small, red-faced youth.  \"Come in, come in,\" he said.\nK. let himself be led by him, and it turned out that there was -\nsurprisingly in a densely packed crowd of people moving to and fro - a\nnarrow passage which may have been the division between two factions;\nthis idea was reinforced by the fact that in the first few rows to the\nleft and the right of him there was hardly any face looking in his\ndirection, he saw nothing but the backs of people directing their speech\nand their movements only towards members of their own side.  Most of\nthem were dressed in black, in old, long, formal frock coats that hung\ndown loosely around them.  These clothes were the only thing that\npuzzled  K., as he would otherwise have taken the whole assembly for a\nlocal political meeting.\n\n        At the other end of the hall where K. had been led there was a\nlittle table set at an angle on a very low podium which was as\novercrowded as everywhere else, and behind the table, near the edge of\nthe podium, sat a small, fat, wheezing man who was talking with someone\nbehind him.  This second man was standing with his legs crossed and his\nelbows on the backrest of the chair, provoking much laughter.  From time\nto time he threw his arm in the air as if doing a caricature of someone.\nThe youth who was leading K. had some difficulty in reporting to the\nman.  He had already tried twice to tell him something, standing on tip-\ntoe, but without getting the man's attention as he sat there above him.\nIt was only when one of the people up on the podium drew his attention\nto the youth that the man turned to him and leant down to hear what it\nwas he quietly said.  Then he pulled out his watch and quickly looked\nover at K.  \"You should have been here one hour and five minutes ago,\"\nhe said.  K. was going to give him a reply but had no time to do so, as\nhardly had the man spoken than a general muttering arose all over the\nright hand side of the hall.  \"You should have been here one hour and\nfive minutes ago,\" the man now repeated, raising his voice this time,\nand quickly looked round the hall beneath him.  The muttering also\nbecame immediately louder and, as the man said nothing more, died away\nonly gradually.  Now the hall was much quieter than when K. had entered.\nOnly the people up in the gallery had not stopped passing remarks.  As\nfar as could be distinguished, up in the half-darkness, dust and haze,\nthey seemed to be less well dressed than those below.  Many of them had\nbrought pillows that they had put between their heads and the ceiling so\nthat they would not hurt themselves pressed against it.\n\n        K. had decided he would do more watching than talking, so he did\nnot defend himself for supposedly having come late, and simply said,\n\"Well maybe I have arrived late, I'm here now.\"  There followed loud\napplause, once more from the right hand side of the hall.  Easy people\nto get on your side, thought K., and was bothered only by the quiet from\nthe left hand side which was directly behind him and from which there\nwas applause from only a few individuals.  He wondered what he could say\nto get all of them to support him together or, if that were not\npossible, to at least get the support of the others for a while.\n\n        \"Yes,\" said the man, \"but I'm now no longer under any obligation\nto hear your case\" - there was once more a muttering, but this time it\nwas misleading as the man waved the people's objections aside with his\nhand and continued - \"I will, however, as an exception, continue with it\ntoday.  But you should never arrive late like this again.  And now, step\nforward!\"  Someone jumped down from the podium so that there would be a\nplace free for K., and K. stepped up onto it.  He stood pressed closely\nagainst the table, the press of the crowd behind him was so great that\nhe had to press back against it if he did not want to push the judge's\ndesk down off the podium and perhaps the judge along with it.\n\n        The judge, however, paid no attention to that but sat very\ncomfortably on his chair and, after saying a few words to close his\ndiscussion with the man behind him, reached for a little note book, the\nonly item on his desk.  It was like an old school exercise book and had\nbecome quite misshapen from much thumbing.  \"Now then,\" said the judge,\nthumbing through the book. He turned to K. with the tone of someone who\nknows his facts and said, \"you are a house painter?\"  \"No,\" said K., \"I\nam the chief clerk in a large bank.\"  This reply was followed by\nlaughter among the right hand faction down in the hall, it was so hearty\nthat K. couldn't stop himself joining in with it.  The people supported\nthemselves with their hands on their knees and shook as if suffering a\nserious attack of coughing.  Even some of those in the gallery were\nlaughing.  The judge had become quite cross but seemed to have no power\nover those below him in the hall, he tried to reduce what harm had been\ndone in the gallery and jumped up threatening them, his eyebrows, until\nthen hardly remarkable, pushed themselves up and became big, black and\nbushy over his eyes.\n\n        The left hand side of the hall was still quiet, though, the people\nstood there in rows with their faces looking towards the podium\nlistening to what was being said there, they observed the noise from the\nother side of the hall with the same quietness and even allowed some\nindividuals from their own ranks, here and there, to go forward into the\nother faction.  The people in the left faction were not only fewer in\nnumber than the right but probably were no more important than them,\nalthough their behaviour was calmer and that made it seem like they\nwere.  When K. now began to speak he was convinced he was doing it in\nthe same way as them.\n\n        \"Your question, My Lord, as to whether I am a house painter - in\nfact even more than that, you did not ask at all but merely imposed it\non me - is symptomatic of the whole way these proceedings against me are\nbeing carried out.   Perhaps you will object that there are no\nproceedings against me.  You will be quite right, as there are\nproceedings only if I acknowledge that there are.  But, for the moment,\nI do acknowledge it, out of pity for yourselves to a large extent.  It's\nimpossible not to observe all this business without feeling pity.  I\ndon't say things are being done without due care but I would like to\nmake it clear that it is I who make the acknowledgement.\"\n\nK. stopped speaking and looked down into the hall.  He had spoken\nsharply, more sharply than he had intended, but he had been quite right.\nIt should have been rewarded with some applause here and there but\neverything was quiet, they were all clearly waiting for what would\nfollow, perhaps the quietness was laying the ground for an outbreak of\nactivity that would bring this whole affair to an end.  It was somewhat\ndisturbing that just then the door at the end of the hall opened, the\nyoung washerwoman, who seemed to have finished her work, came in and,\ndespite all her caution, attracted the attention of some of the people\nthere.  It was only the judge who gave K. any direct pleasure, as he\nseemed to have been immediately struck by K.'s words.  Until then, he\nhad listened to him standing, as K.'s speech had taken him by surprise\nwhile he was directing his attention to the gallery.  Now, in the pause,\nhe sat down very slowly, as if he did not want anyone to notice.  He\ntook out the notebook again, probably so that he could give the\nimpression of being calmer.\n\n        \"That won't help you, sir,\" continued K., \"even your little book\nwill only confirm what I say.\"  K. was satisfied to hear nothing but his\nown quiet words in this room full of strangers, and he even dared\ncasually to pick up the examining judge's notebook and, touching it only\nwith the tips of his fingers as if it were something revolting, lifted\nit in the air, holding it just by one of the middle pages so that the\nothers on each side of it, closely written, blotted and yellowing,\nflapped down.  \"Those are the official notes of the examining judge,\" he\nsaid, and let the notebook fall down onto the desk.  \"You can read in\nyour book as much as you like, sir, I really don't have anything in this\ncharge book to be afraid of, even though I don't have access to it as I\nwouldn't want it in my hand, I can only touch it with two fingers.\"  The\njudge grabbed the notebook from where it had fallen on the desk - which\ncould only have been a sign of his deep humiliation, or at least that is\nhow it must have been perceived - tried to tidy it up a little, and held\nit once more in front of himself in order to read from it.\n\n        The people in the front row looked up at him, showing such tension\non their faces that he looked back down at them for some time.  Every\none of them was an old man, some of them with white beards.  Could they\nperhaps be the crucial group who could turn the whole assembly one way\nor the other?  They had sunk into a state of  motionlessness while K.\ngave his oration, and it had not been possible to raise them from this\npassivity even when the judge was being humiliated.  \"What has happened\nto me,\" continued K., with less of the vigour he had had earlier, he\ncontinually scanned the faces in the first row, and this gave his\naddress a somewhat nervous and distracted character, \"what has happened\nto me is not just an isolated case.  If it were it would not be of much\nimportance as it's not of much importance to me, but it is a symptom of\nproceedings which are carried out against many.  It's on behalf of them\nthat I stand here now, not for myself alone.\"\n\n        Without having intended it, he had raised his voice.  Somewhere in\nthe hall, someone raised his hands and applauded him shouting, \"Bravo!\nWhy not then?  Bravo!  Again I say, Bravo!\"  Some of the men in the\nfirst row groped around in their beards, none of them looked round to\nsee who was shouting.  Not even K. thought him of any importance but it\ndid raise his spirits; he no longer thought it at all necessary that all\nof those in the hall should applaud him, it was enough if the majority\nof them began  to think about the matter and if only one of them, now\nand then, was persuaded.\n\n        \"I'm not trying to be a successful orator,\" said K. after this\nthought, \"that's probably more than I'm capable of anyway.  I'm sure the\nexamining judge can speak far better than I can, it is part of his job\nafter all.  All that I want is a public discussion of a public wrong.\nListen: ten days ago I was placed under arrest, the arrest itself is\nsomething I laugh about but that's beside the point.  They came for me\nin the morning when I was still in bed.  Maybe the order had been given\nto arrest some house painter - that seems possible after what the judge\nhas said - someone who is as innocent as I am, but it was me they chose.\nThere were two police thugs occupying the next room.  They could not\nhave taken better precautions if I had been a dangerous robber.  And\nthese policemen were unprincipled riff-raff, they talked at me till I\nwas sick of it, they wanted bribes, they wanted to trick me into giving\nthem my clothes, they wanted money, supposedly so that they could bring\nme my breakfast after they had blatantly eaten my own breakfast in front\nof my eyes.  And even that was not enough.  I was led in front of the\nsupervisor in another room.  This was the room of a lady who I have a\nlot of respect for, and I was forced to look on while the supervisor and\nthe policemen made quite a mess of this room because of me, although not\nthrough any fault of mine.  It was not easy to stay calm, but I managed\nto do so and was completely calm when I asked the supervisor why it was\nthat I was under arrest.  If he were here he would have to confirm what\nI say.  I can see him now, sitting on the chair belonging to that lady I\nmentioned - a picture of dull-witted arrogance.  What do you think he\nanswered?  What he told me, gentlemen, was basically nothing at all;\nperhaps he really did know nothing, he had placed me under arrest and\nwas satisfied.  In fact he had done more than that and brought three\njunior employees from the bank where I work into the lady's room; they\nhad made themselves busy interfering with some photographs that belonged\nto the lady and causing a mess.  There was, of course, another reason\nfor bringing these employees; they, just like my landlady and her maid,\nwere expected to spread the news of my arrest and damage my public\nreputation and in particular to remove me from my position at the bank.\nWell they didn't succeed in any of that, not in the slightest, even my\nlandlady, who is quite a simple person - and I will give you here her\nname in full respect, her name is Mrs. Grubach - even Mrs. Grubach was\nunderstanding enough to see that an arrest like this has no more\nsignificance than an attack carried out on the street by some youths who\nare not kept under proper control.  I repeat, this whole affair has\ncaused me nothing but unpleasantness and temporary irritation, but could\nit not also have had some far worse consequences?\"\n\n        K. broke off here and looked at the judge, who said nothing.  As\nhe did so he thought he saw the judge use a movement of his eyes to give\na sign to someone in the crowd.  K. smiled and said, \"And now the judge,\nright next to me, is giving a secret sign to someone among you.  There\nseems to be someone among you who is taking directions from above.  I\ndon't know whether the sign is meant to produce booing or applause, but\nI'll resist trying to guess what its meaning is too soon.  It really\ndoesn't matter to me, and I give his lordship the judge my full and\npublic permission to stop giving secret signs to his paid subordinate\ndown there and give his orders in words instead; let him just say \"Boo\nnow!,\" and then the next time \"Clap now!\".\n\n        Whether it was embarrassment or impatience, the judge rocked\nbackwards and forwards on his seat.  The man behind him, whom he had\nbeen talking with earlier, leant forward again, either to give him a few\ngeneral words of encouragement or some specific piece of advice.  Below\nthem in the hall the people talked to each other quietly but animatedly.\nThe two factions  had earlier seemed to hold views strongly opposed to\neach other but now they began to intermingle, a few individuals pointed\nup at K., others pointed at the judge.   The air in the room was fuggy\nand extremely oppressive, those who were standing furthest away could\nhardly even be seen through it.  It must have been especially\ntroublesome for those visitors who were in the gallery, as they were\nforced to quietly ask the participants in the assembly what exactly was\nhappening, albeit with timid glances at the judge.  The replies they\nreceived were just as quiet, and given behind the protection of a raised\nhand.\n\n        \"I have nearly finished what I have to say,\" said K., and as there\nwas no bell available he struck the desk with his fist in a way that\nstartled the judge and his advisor and made them look up from each\nother.  \"None of this concerns me, and I am therefore able to make a calm\nassessment of it, and, assuming that this so-called court is of any real\nimportance, it will be very much to your advantage to listen to what I\nhave to say.  If you want to discuss what I say, please don't bother to\nwrite it down until later on, I don't have any time to waste and I'll\nsoon be leaving.\"\n\n        There was immediate silence, which showed how well K. was in\ncontrol of the crowd.  There were no shouts among them as there had been\nat the start, no-one even applauded, but if they weren't already\npersuaded they seemed very close to it.\n\n        K was pleased at the tension among all the people there as they\nlistened to him, a rustling rose from the silence which was more\ninvigorating than the most ecstatic applause could have been.  \"There is\nno doubt,\" he said quietly, \"that there is some enormous organisation\ndetermining what is said by this court.  In my case this includes my\narrest and the examination taking place here today, an organisation that\nemploys policemen who can be bribed, oafish supervisors and judges of\nwhom nothing better can be said than that they are not as arrogant as\nsome others.  This organisation even maintains a high-level judiciary\nalong with its train of countless servants, scribes, policemen and all\nthe other assistance that  it needs, perhaps even executioners and\ntorturers - I'm not afraid of using those words. And what, gentlemen, is\nthe purpose of this enormous organisation?  Its purpose is to arrest\ninnocent people and wage pointless prosecutions against them which, as\nin my case, lead to no result.  How are we to avoid those in office\nbecoming deeply corrupt when everything is devoid of meaning?  That is\nimpossible, not even the highest judge would be able to achieve that for\nhimself.  That is why policemen try to steal the clothes off the back of\nthose they arrest, that is why supervisors break into the homes of\npeople they do not know, that is why innocent people are humiliated in\nfront of crowds rather than being given a proper trial.  The policemen\nonly talked about the warehouses where they put the property of those\nthey arrest, I would like to see these warehouses where the hard won\npossessions of people under arrest is left to decay, if, that is, it's\nnot stolen by the thieving hands of the warehouse workers.\"\n\n        K. was interrupted by a screeching from the far end of the hall,\nhe shaded his eyes to see that far, as the dull light of day made the\nsmoke whitish and hard to see through.  It was the washerwoman whom K.\nhad recognised as a likely source of disturbance as soon as she had\nentered.  It was hard to see now whether it was her fault or not.  K.\ncould only see that a man had pulled her into a corner by the door and\nwas pressing himself against her.  But it was not her who was screaming,\nbut the man, he had opened his mouth wide and looked up at the ceiling.\nA small circle had formed around the two of them, the visitors near him\nin the gallery seemed delighted that the serious tone K. had introduced\ninto the gathering had been disturbed in this way.   K.'s first thought\nwas to run over there, and he also thought that everyone would want to\nbring things back into order there or at least to make the pair leave\nthe room, but the first row of people in front of him stayed were they\nwere, no-one moved and no-one let K. through.  On the contrary, they\nstood in his way, old men held out their arms in front of him and a hand\nfrom somewhere - he did not have the time to turn round - took hold of\nhis collar.  K., by this time, had forgotten about the pair, it seemed\nto him that his freedom was being limited as if his arrest was being\ntaken seriously, and, without any thought for what he was doing, he\njumped down from the podium.  Now he stood face to face with the crowd.\nHad he judged the people properly?  Had he put too much faith in the\neffect of his speech?  Had they been putting up a pretence all the time\nhe had been speaking, and now that he come to the end and to what must\nfollow, were they tired of pretending?  What faces they were, all around\nhim!  Dark, little eyes flickered here and there, cheeks drooped down\nlike on drunken men, their long beards were thin and stiff, if they took\nhold of them it was more like they were making their hands into claws,\nnot as if they were taking hold of their own beards.  But underneath\nthose beards - and this was the real discovery made by K. - there were\nbadges of various sizes and colours shining on the collars of their\ncoats.  As far as he could see, every one of them was wearing one of\nthese badges.  All of them belonged to the same group, even though they\nseemed to be divided to the right and the left of him, and when he\nsuddenly turned round he saw the same badge on the collar of the\nexamining judge who calmly looked down at him with his hands in his lap.\n\"So,\" called out K, throwing his arms in the air as if this sudden\nrealisation needed more room, \"all of you are working for this\norganisation, I see now that you are all the very bunch of cheats and\nliars I've just been speaking about, you've all pressed yourselves in\nhere in order to listen in and snoop on me, you gave the impression of\nhaving formed into factions, one of you even applauded me to test me\nout, and you wanted to learn how to trap an innocent man!   Well, I hope\nyou haven't come here for nothing, I hope you've either had some fun\nfrom someone who expected you to defend his innocence or else - let go\nof me or I'll hit you,\" shouted K. to a quivery old man who had pressed\nhimself especially close to him - \"or else that you've actually learned\nsomething.  And so I wish you good luck in your trade.\"  He briskly took\nhis hat from where it lay on the edge of the table and, surrounded by a\nsilence caused perhaps by the completeness of their surprise, pushed his\nway to the exit.  However, the examining judge seems to have moved even\nmore quickly than K., as he was waiting for him at the doorway.  \"One\nmoment,\" he said.  K. stood where he was, but looked at the door with\nhis hand already on its handle rather than at the judge.  \"I merely\nwanted to draw your attention,\" said the judge, \"to something you seem\nnot yet to be aware of: today, you have robbed yourself of the\nadvantages that a hearing of this sort always gives to someone who is\nunder arrest.\"  K. laughed towards the door.  \"You bunch of louts,\" he\ncalled, \"you can keep all your hearings as a present from me,\" then\nopened the door and hurried down the steps.  Behind him, the noise of\nthe assembly rose as it became lively once more and probably began to\ndiscuss these events as if making a scientific study of them.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Three\n In the empty Courtroom - The Student - The Offices\n\n        Every day over the following week, K. expected another summons to\narrive, he could not believe that his rejection of any more hearings had\nbeen taken literally, and when the expected summons really had not come\nby Saturday evening he took it to mean that he was expected, without\nbeing told, to appear at the same place at the same time.  So on Sunday,\nhe set out once more in the same direction, going without hesitation up\nthe steps and through the corridors; some of the people remembered him\nand greeted him from their doorways, but he no longer needed to ask\nanyone the way and soon arrived at the right door.  It was opened as\nsoon as he knocked and, paying no attention to the woman he had seen\nlast time who was standing at the doorway, he was about to go straight\ninto the adjoining room when she said to him \"There's no session today\".\n\"What do you mean; no session?\" he asked, unable to believe it.  But the\nwoman persuaded him by opening the door to the next room.  It was indeed\nempty, and looked even more dismal empty than it had the previous\nSunday.  On the podium stood the table exactly as it had been before\nwith a few books laying on it.  \"Can I have a look at those books?\"\nasked K., not because he was especially curious but so that he would not\nhave come for nothing.  \"No,\" said the woman as she re-closed the door,\n\"that's not allowed.  Those books belong to the examining judge.\"  \"I\nsee,\" said K., and nodded, \"those books must be law books, and that's\nhow this court does things, not only to try people who are innocent but\neven to try them without letting them know what's going on.\"  \"I expect\nyou're right,\" said the woman, who had not understood exactly what he\nmeant.  \"I'd better go away again, then,\" said K.\n\"Should I give a message to the examining judge?\" asked the woman.  \"Do\nyou know him, then?\" asked K.  \"Of course I know him,\" said the woman,\n\"my husband is the court usher.\"  It was only now that K. noticed that\nthe room, which before had held nothing but a wash-tub, had been fitted\nout as a living room.  The woman saw how surprised he was and said,\n\"Yes, we're allowed to live here as we like, only we have to clear the\nroom out when the court's in session.  There's lots of disadvantages to\nmy husband's job.\"  \"It's not so much the room that surprises me,\" said\nK., looking at her crossly, \"it's your being married that shocks me.\"\n\"Are you thinking about what happened last time the court was in\nsession, when I disturbed what you were saying?\" asked the woman.  \"Of\ncourse,\" said K., \"it's in the past now and I've nearly forgotten about\nit, but at the time it made me furious.  And now you tell me yourself\nthat you are a married woman.\"  \"It wasn't any disadvantage for you to\nhave your speech interrupted.  The way they talked about you after you'd\ngone was really bad.\"  \"That could well be,\" said K., turning away, \"but\nit does not excuse you.\"  \"There's no-one I know who'd hold it against\nme,\" said the woman. \"Him, who put his arms around me, he's been chasing\nafter me for a long time.  I might not be very attractive for most\npeople, but I am for him.  I've got no protection from him, even my\nhusband has had to get used to it; if he wants to keep his job he's got\nto put up with it as that man's a student and he'll almost certainly be\nvery powerful later on.  He's always after me, he'd only just left when\nyou arrived.\"  \"That fits in with everything else,\" said K., \"I'm not\nsurprised.\"  \"Do you want to make things a bit better here?\" the woman\nasked slowly, watching him as if she were saying something that could be\nas dangerous for K. as for herself.  \"That's what I thought when I heard\nyou speak, I really liked what you said.  Mind you, I only heard part of\nit, I missed the beginning of it and at the end I was lying on the floor\nwith the student - it's so horrible here,\" she said after a pause, and\ntook hold of K.'s hand.  \"Do you believe you really will be able to make\nthings better?\"  K. smiled and twisted his hand round a little in her\nsoft hands.  \"It's really not my job to make things better here, as you\nput it,\" he said, \"and if you said that to the examining judge he would\nlaugh at you or punish you for it.  I really would not have become\ninvolved in this matter if I could have helped it, and I would have lost\nno sleep worrying about how this court needs to be made better.  But\nbecause I'm told that I have been arrested - and I am under arrest - it\nforces me to take some action, and to do so for my own sake.  However,\nif I can be of some service to you in the process I will, of course, be\nglad to do so.  And I will be glad to do so not only for the sake of\ncharity but also because you can be of some help to me.\"  \"How could I\nhelp you, then?\" said the woman.  \"You could, for example, show me the\nbooks on the table there.\"  \"Yes, certainly,\" the woman cried, and\npulled K. along behind her as she rushed to them.  The books were old\nand well worn, the cover of one of them had nearly broken through in its\nmiddle, and it was held together with a few threads.  \"Everything is so\ndirty here,\" said K., shaking his head, and before he could pick the\nbooks up the woman wiped some of the dust off with her apron.  K. took\nhold of the book that lay on top and threw it open, an indecent picture\nappeared.  A man and a woman sat naked on a sofa, the base intent of\nwhoever drew it was easy to see but he had been so grossly lacking in\nskill that all that anyone could really make out were the man and the\nwoman who dominated the picture with their bodies, sitting in overly\nupright postures that created a false perspective and made it difficult\nfor them to approach each other.  K. didn't thumb through that book any\nmore, but just threw open the next one at its title page, it was a novel\nwith the title, What Grete Suffered from her Husband, Hans.  \"So this is\nthe sort of law book they study here,\" said K., \"this is the sort of\nperson sitting in judgement over me.\"  \"I can help you,\" said the woman,\n\"would you like me to?\"  \"Could you really do that without placing\nyourself in danger?  You did say earlier on that your husband is wholly\ndependent on his superiors.\"  \"I still want to help you,\" said the\nwoman, \"come over here, we've got to talk about it.  Don't say any more\nabout what danger I'm in, I only fear danger where I want to fear it.\nCome over here.\"  She pointed to the podium and invited him to sit down\non the step with her.  \"You've got lovely dark eyes,\" she said after\nthey had sat down, looking up into K.'s face, \"people say I've got nice\neyes too, but yours are much nicer.  It was the first thing I noticed\nwhen you first came here.  That's even why I came in here, into the\nassembly room, afterwards, I'd never normally do that, I'm not really\neven allowed to.\"  So that's what all this is about, thought K., she's\noffering herself to me, she's as degenerate as everything else around\nhere, she's had enough of the court officials, which is understandable I\nsuppose, and so she approaches any stranger and makes compliments about\nhis eyes.  With that, K. stood up in silence as if he had spoken his\nthoughts out loud and thus explained his action to the woman.  \"I don't\nthink you can be of any assistance to me,\" he said, \"to be of any real\nassistance you would need to be in contact with high officials.  But I'm\nsure you only know the lower employees, and there are crowds of them\nmilling about here.  I'm sure you're very familiar with them and could\nachieve a great deal through them, I've no doubt of that, but the most\nthat could be done through them would have no bearing at all on the\nfinal outcome of the trial.  You, on the other hand, would lose some of\nyour friends as a result, and I have no wish of that.  Carry on with\nthese people in the same way as you have been, as it does seem to me to\nbe something you cannot do without.  I have no regrets in saying this\nas, in return for your compliment to me, I also find you rather\nattractive, especially when you look at me as sadly as you are now,\nalthough you really have no reason to do so.  You belong to the people I\nhave to combat, and you're very comfortable among them, you're even in\nlove with the student, or if you don't love him you do at least prefer\nhim to your husband.  It's easy to see that from what you've been\nsaying.\"  \"No!\" she shouted, remained sitting where she was and grasped\nK.'s hand, which he failed to pull away fast enough.  \"You can't go away\nnow, you can't go away when you've misjudged me like that!  Are you\nreally capable of going away now?  Am I really so worthless that you\nwon't even do me the favour of staying a little bit longer?\"  \"You\nmisunderstand me,\" said K., sitting back down, \"if it's really important\nto you for me to stay here then I'll be glad to do so, I have plenty of\ntime, I came here thinking there would be a trial taking place.  All I\nmeant with what I said just now was to ask you not to do anything on my\nbehalf in the proceedings against me.  But even that is nothing for you\nto worry about when you consider that there's nothing hanging on the\noutcome of this trial, and that, whatever the verdict, I will just laugh\nat it.  And that's even presupposing it ever even reaches any\nconclusion, which I very much doubt.  I think it's much more likely that\nthe court officials will be too lazy, too forgetful, or even to fearful\never to continue with these proceedings and that they will soon be\nabandoned if they haven't been abandoned already.  It's even possible\nthat they will pretend to be carrying on with the trial in the hope of\nreceiving a large bribe, although I can tell you now that that will be\nquite in vain as I pay bribes to no-one.  Perhaps one favour you could\ndo me would be to tell the examining judge, or anyone else who likes to\nspread important news, that I will never be induced to pay any sort of\nbribe through any stratagem of theirs - and I'm sure they have many\nstratagems at their disposal.  There is no prospect of that, you can\ntell them that quite openly.  And what's more, I expect they have\nalready noticed themselves, or even if they haven't, this affair is\nreally not so important to me as they think.  Those gentlemen would only\nsave some work for themselves, or at least some unpleasantness for me,\nwhich, however, I am glad to endure if I know that each piece of\nunpleasantness for me is a blow against them.  And I will make quite\nsure it is a blow against them.  Do you actually know the judge?\"\n\"Course I do,\" said the woman, \"he was the first one I thought of when I\noffered to help you.  I didn't know he's only a minor official, but if\nyou say so it must be true.  Mind you, I still think the report he gives\nto his superiors must have some influence.  And he writes so many\nreports.  You say these officials are lazy, but they're certainly not\nall lazy, especially this examining judge, he writes ever such a lot.\nLast Sunday, for instance, that session went on till the evening.\nEveryone had gone, but the examining judge, he stayed in the hall, I had\nto bring him a lamp in, all I had was a little kitchen lamp but he was\nvery satisfied with it and started to write straight away.  Meantime my\nhusband arrived, he always has the day off on Sundays, we got the\nfurniture back in and got our room sorted out and then a few of the\nneighbours came, we sat and talked for a bit by a candle, in short, we\nforgot all about the examining judge and went to bed.  All of a sudden\nin the night, it must have been quite late in the night, I wakes up,\nnext to the bed, there's the examining judge shading the lamp with his\nhand so that there's no light from it falls on my husband, he didn't\nneed to be as careful as that, the way my husband sleeps the light\nwouldn't have woken him up anyway.  I was quite shocked and nearly\nscreamed, but the judge was very friendly, warned me I should be\ncareful, he whispered to me he's been writing all this time, and now\nhe's brought me the lamp back, and he'll never forget how I looked when\nhe found me there asleep.  What I mean, with all this, I just wanted to\ntell you how the examining judge really does write lots of reports,\nespecially about you as questioning you was definitely one of the main\nthings on the agenda that Sunday.   If he writes reports as long as that\nthey must be of some importance.   And besides all that, you can see\nfrom what happened that the examining judge is after me, and it's right\nnow, when he's first begun to notice me, that I can have a lot of\ninfluence on him.  And I've got other proof I mean a lot to him, too.\nYesterday, he sent that student to me, the one he really trusts and who\nhe works with, he sent him with a present for me, silk stockings.  He\nsaid it was because I clear up in the courtroom but that's only a\npretence, that job's no more than what I'm supposed to do, it's what my\nhusband gets paid for.  Nice stockings, they are, look,\" - she stretched\nout her leg, drew her skirt up to her knee and looked, herself, at the\nstocking - \"they are nice stockings, but they're too good for me,\nreally.\"\n\n        She suddenly interrupted herself and lay her hand on K.'s as if\nshe wanted to calm him down, and whispered, \"Be quiet, Berthold is\nwatching us.\"  K. slowly looked up.  In the doorway to the courtroom\nstood a young man, he was short, his legs were not quite straight, and\nhe continually moved his finger round in a short, thin, red beard with\nwhich he hoped to make himself look dignified.  K. looked at him with\nsome curiosity, he was the first student he had ever met of the\nunfamiliar discipline of jurisprudence, face to face at least, a man who\nwould even most likely attain high office one day.  The student, in\ncontrast, seemed to take no notice of K. at all, he merely withdrew his\nfinger from his beard long enough to beckon to the woman and went over\nto the window, the woman leant over to K. and whispered, \"Don't be cross\nwith me, please don't, and please don't think ill of me either, I've got\nto go to him now, to this horrible man, just look at his bent legs.  But\nI'll come straight back and then I'll go with you if you'll take me,\nI'll go wherever you want, you can do whatever you like with me, I'll be\nhappy if I can be away from here for as long as possible, it'd be best\nif I could get away from here for good.\"  She stroked K.'s hand once\nmore, jumped up and ran over to the window.  Before he realised it, K.\ngrasped for her hand but failed to catch it.   He really was attracted\nto the woman, and even after thinking hard about it could find no good\nreason why he should not give in to her allure.  It briefly crossed his\nmind that the woman meant to entrap him on behalf of the court, but that\nwas an objection he had no difficulty in fending off.  In what way could\nshe entrap him?  Was he not still free, so free that he could crush the\nentire court whenever he wanted, as least where it concerned him?  Could\nhe not have that much confidence in himself?  And her offer of help\nsounded sincere, and maybe it wasn't quite worthless.  And maybe there\nwas no better revenge against the examining judge and his cronies than\nto take this woman from him and have her for himself.  Maybe then, after\nmuch hard work writing dishonest reports about K., the judge would go to\nthe woman's bed late one night and find it empty.  And it would be empty\nbecause she belonged to K., because this woman at the window, this lush,\nsupple, warm body in its sombre clothes of rough, heavy material\nbelonged to him, totally to him and to him alone.  Once he had settled\nhis thoughts towards the woman in this way, he began to find the quiet\nconversation at the window was taking too long, he rapped on the podium\nwith his knuckles, and then even with his fist.  The student briefly\nlooked away from the woman to glance at K. over his shoulder but did\nallow himself to be disturbed, in fact he even pressed himself close to\nthe woman and put his arms around her.  She dropped her head down low as\nif listening to him carefully, as she did so he kissed her right on the\nneck, hardly even interrupting what he was saying.   K. saw this as\nconfirmation of the tyranny the student held over the woman and which\nshe had already complained about, he stood up and walked up and down the\nroom.  Glancing sideways at the student, he wondered what would be the\nquickest possible way to get rid of him, and so it was not unwelcome to\nhim when the student, clearly disturbed by K.'s to-ing and fro-ing which\nK. had now developed into a stamping up and down, said to him,\n\"You don't have to stay here, you know, if you're getting impatient.\nYou could have gone earlier, no-one would have missed you.  In fact you\nshould have gone, you should have left as quickly as possible as soon as\nI got here.\"  This comment could have caused all possible rage to break\nout between them, but K. also bore in mind that this was a prospective\ncourt official speaking to a disfavoured defendant, and he might well\nhave been taking pride in speaking in this way.  K. remained standing\nquite close to him and said with a smile, \"You're quite right, I am\nimpatient, but the easiest way to settle this impatience would be if you\nleft us.  On the other hand, if you've come here to study - you are a\nstudent, I hear - I'll be quite happy to leave the room to you and go\naway with the woman.  I'm sure you'll still have a lot of study to do\nbefore you're made into a judge.  It's true that I'm still not all that\nfamiliar with your branch of jurisprudence but I take it it involves a\nlot more than speaking roughly - and I see you have no shame in doing\nthat extremely well.\"  \"He shouldn't have been allowed to move about so\nfreely,\" said the student, as if he wanted to give the woman an\nexplanation for K.'s insults, \"that was a mistake.  I've told the\nexamining judge so.  He should at least have been detained in his room\nbetween hearings.  Sometimes it's impossible to understand what the\njudge thinks he's doing.\"\n\"You're wasting your breath,\" said K., then he reached his hand out\ntowards the woman and said, \"come with me.\"  \"So that's it,\" said the\nstudent, \"oh no, you're not going to get her,\" and with a strength you\nwould not have expected from him, he glanced tenderly at her, lifted her\nup on one arm and, his back bent under the weight, ran with her to the\ndoor.  In this way he showed, unmistakeably, that he was to some extent\nafraid of K., but he nonetheless dared to provoke him still further by\nstroking and squeezing the woman's arm with his free hand.  K. ran the\nfew steps up to him, but when he had reached him and was about to take\nhold of him and, if necessary, throttle him, the woman said, \"It's no\ngood, it's the examining judge who's sent for me, I daren't go with you,\nthis little bastard...\" and here she ran her hand over the student's\nface, \"this little bastard won't let me.\"  \"And you don't want to be set\nfree!\" shouted K., laying his hand on the student's shoulder, who then\nsnapped at it with his teeth.  \"No!\" shouted the woman, pushing K. away\nwith both hands, \"no, no don't do that, what d'you think you're doing!?\nThat'd be the end of me.  Let go of him, please just let go of him.\nHe's only carrying out the judge's orders, he's carrying me to him.\"\n\"Let him take you then, and I want to see nothing more of you,\" said K.,\nenraged by his disappointment and giving the student a thump in the back\nso that he briefly stumbled and then, glad that he had not fallen,\nimmediately jumped up all the higher with his burden.  K. followed them\nslowly.  He realised that this was the first unambiguous setback he had\nsuffered from these people.  It was of course nothing to worry about, he\naccepted the setback only because he was looking for a fight.  If he\nstayed at home and carried on with his normal life he would be a\nthousand times superior to these people and could get any of them out of\nhis way just with a kick.  And he imagined the most laughable scene\npossible as an example of this, if this contemptible student, this\ninflated child, this knock-kneed redbeard, if he were kneeling at Elsa's\nbed wringing his hands and begging for forgiveness.  K. so enjoyed\nimagining this scene that he decided to take the student along to Elsa\nwith him if ever he should get the opportunity.\n\n        K. was curious to see where the woman would be taken and he\nhurried over to the door, the student was not likely to carry her\nthrough the streets on his arm.  It turned out that the journey was far\nshorter.  Directly opposite the flat there was a narrow flight of wooden\nsteps which probably led up to the attic, they turned as they went so\nthat it was not possible to see where they ended.  The student carried\nthe woman up these steps, and after the exertions of running with her he\nwas soon groaning and moving very slowly.  The woman waved down at K.\nand by raising and lowering her shoulders she tried to show that she was\nan innocent party in this abduction, although the gesture did not show a\nlot of regret.  K. watched her without expression like a stranger, he\nwanted to show neither that he was disappointed nor that he would easily\nget over his disappointment.\n\n        The two of them had disappeared, but K. remained standing in the\ndoorway.  He had to accept that the woman had not only cheated him but\nthat she had also lied to him when she said she was being taken to the\nexamining judge.  The examining judge certainly wouldn't be sitting and\nwaiting in the attic.  The wooden stairs would explain nothing to him\nhowever long he stared at them.  Then K. noticed a small piece of paper\nnext to them, went across to it and read, in a childish and unpractised\nhand, \"Entrance to the Court Offices\".  Were the court offices here, in\nthe attic of this tenement, then?  If that was how they were\naccommodated it did not attract much respect, and it was some comfort\nfor the accused to realise how little money this court had at its\ndisposal if it had to locate its offices in a place where the tenants of\nthe building, who were themselves among the poorest of people, would\nthrow their unneeded junk.  On the other hand, it was possible that the\nofficials  had enough money but that they squandered it on themselves\nrather than use it for the court's purposes.  Going by K.'s experience\nof them so far, that even seemed probable, except that if the court were\nallowed to decay in that way it would not just humiliate the accused but\nalso give him more encouragement than if the court were simply  in a\nstate of poverty.  K. also now understood that the court was ashamed to\nsummon those it accused to the attic of this building for the initial\nhearing, and why it preferred to impose upon them in their own homes.\nWhat a position it was that K. found himself in, compared with the judge\nsitting up in the attic!  K., at the bank, had a big office with an\nante-room, and had an enormous window through which he could look down\nat the activity in the square.  It was true, though, that he had no\nsecondary income from bribes and fraud, and he couldn't tell a servant\nto bring him a woman up to the office on his arm.  K., however, was\nquite willing to do without such things, in this life at least.  K. was\nstill looking at the notice when a man came up the stairs, looked\nthrough the open door into the living room where it was also possible to\nsee the courtroom, and finally asked K. whether he had just seen a woman\nthere.  \"You're the court usher, aren't you?\" asked K.  \"That's right,\"\nsaid the man, \"oh, yes, you're defendant K., I recognise you now as\nwell.  Nice to see you here.\"  And he offered K. his hand, which was far\nfrom what K. had expected.  And when K. said nothing, he added, \"There's\nno court session planned for today, though.\"  \"I know that,\" said K. as\nhe looked at the usher's civilian coat which, beside its ordinary\nbuttons, displayed two gilded ones as the only sign of his office and\nseemed to have been taken from an old army officer's coat.  \"I was\nspeaking with your wife a little while ago.  She is no longer here.  The\nstudent has carried her off to the examining judge.\"  \"Listen to this,\"\nsaid the usher, \"they're always carrying her away from me.  It's Sunday\ntoday, and it's not part of my job to do any work today, but they send\nme off with some message which isn't even necessary just to get me away\nfrom here.  What they do is they send me off not too far away so that I\ncan still hope to get back on time if I really hurry.  So off I go\nrunning as fast as I can, shout the message through the crack in the\ndoor of the office I've been sent to, so out of breath they'll hardly be\nable to understand it, run back here again, but the student's been even\nfaster than I have - well he's got less far to go, he's only got to run\ndown the steps.  If I wasn't so dependent on them I'd have squashed the\nstudent against the wall here a long time ago.  Right here, next to the\nsign.  I'm always dreaming of doing that.  Just here, just above the\nfloor, that's where he's crushed onto the wall, his arms stretched out,\nhis fingers spread apart, his crooked legs twisted round into a circle\nand blood squirted out all around him.  It's only ever been a dream so\nfar, though.\"  \"Is there nothing else you do?\" asked K. with a smile.\n\"Nothing that I know of,\" said the usher.  \"And it's going to get even\nworse now, up till now he's only been carrying her off for himself, now\nhe's started carrying her off for the judge and all, just like I'd\nalways said he would.\"  \"Does your wife, then, not share some of the\nresponsibility?\" asked K.  He had to force himself as he asked this\nquestion, as he, too, felt so jealous now.  \"Course she does,\" said the\nusher, \"it's more her fault than theirs.  It was her who attached\nherself to him.  All he did, he just chases after any woman.  There's\nfive flats in this block alone where he's been thrown out after working\nhis way in there.  And my wife is the best looking woman in the whole\nbuilding, but it's me who's not even allowed to defend himself.\"  \"If\nthat's how things are, then there's nothing that can be done,\" said K.\n\"Well why not?\" asked the usher.  \"He's a coward that student, if he\nwants to lay a finger on my wife all you'd have to do is give him such a\ngood hiding he'd never dare do it again.  But I'm not allowed to do\nthat, and nobody else is going to do me the favour as they're all afraid\nof his power.  The only one who could do it is a man like you.\"  \"What,\nhow could I do it?\" asked K. in astonishment.\n\"Well you're facing a charge, aren't you,\" said the usher.  \"Yes, but\nthat's all the more reason for me to be afraid.  Even if he has no\ninfluence on the outcome of the trial he probably has some on the\ninitial examination.\"  \"Yes, exactly,\" said the usher, as if K.'s view\nhad been just as correct as his own.  \"Only we don't usually get any\ntrials heard here with no hope at all.\"  \"I am not of the same opinion\",\nsaid K., \"although that ought not to prevent me from dealing with the\nstudent if the opportunity arises.\"  \"I would be very grateful to you,\"\nsaid the usher of the court, somewhat formally, not really seeming to\nbelieve that his highest wish could be fulfilled.  \"Perhaps,\" continued\nK., \"perhaps there are some other officials of yours here, perhaps all\nof them, who would deserve the same.\"  \"Oh yes, yes,\" said the usher, as\nif this was a matter of course.  Then he looked at K. trustingly which,\ndespite all his friendliness, he had not done until then, and added,\n\"they're always rebelling.\"  But the conversation seemed to have become\na little uncomfortable for him, as he broke it off by saying, \"now I\nhave to report to the office.  Would you like to come with me?\"\n\"There's nothing for me to do there,\" said K.\n\"You'd be able to have a look at it.  No-one will take any notice of\nyou.\"  \"Is it worth seeing then?\" asked K. hesitatingly, although he\nfelt very keen to go with him.  \"Well,\" said the usher, \"I thought you'd\nbe interested in it.\"  \"Alright then,\" said K. finally, \"I'll come with\nyou.\"  And, quicker than the usher himself, he ran up the steps.\n\n        At the entrance he nearly fell over, as behind the door there was\nanother step. \"They don't show much concern for the public,\" he said.\n\"They don't show any concern at all,\" said the usher, \"just look at the\nwaiting room here.\"  It consisted of a long corridor from which roughly\nmade doors led out to the separate departments of the attic.  There was\nno direct source of light but it was not entirely dark as many of the\ndepartments, instead of solid walls, had just wooden bars reaching up to\nthe ceiling to separate them from the corridor.  The light made its way\nin through them, and it was also possible to see individual officials\nthrough them as they sat writing at their desks or stood up at the\nwooden frameworks and watched the people on the corridor through the\ngaps.  There were only a few people in the corridor, probably because it\nwas Sunday.  They were not very impressive.  They sat, equally spaced,\non two rows of long wooden benches which had been placed along both\nsides of the corridor.  All of them were carelessly dressed although the\nexpressions on their faces, their bearing, the style of their beards and\nmany details which were hard to identify showed that they belonged to\nthe upper classes.  There were no coat hooks for them to use, and so\nthey had placed their hats under the bench, each probably having\nfollowed the example of the others.  When those who were sitting nearest\nthe door saw K. and the usher of the court they stood up to greet them,\nand when the others saw that, they also thought they had to greet them,\nso that as the two of them went by all the people there stood up.  None\nof them stood properly upright, their backs were bowed, their knees\nbent, they stood like beggars on the street.  K. waited for the usher,\nwho was following just behind him.  \"They must all be very dispirited,\"\nhe said.  \"Yes,\" said the usher, \"they are the accused, everyone you see\nhere has been accused.\"  \"Really!\" said K.  \"They're colleagues of mine\nthen.\"  And he turned to the nearest one, a tall, thin man with hair\nthat was nearly grey.  \"What is it you are waiting for here?\" asked K.,\npolitely, but the man was startled at being spoken to unexpectedly,\nwhich was all the more pitiful to see because the man clearly had some\nexperience of the world and elsewhere would certainly have been able to\nshow his superiority and would not have easily given up the advantage he\nhad acquired.  Here, though, he did not know what answer to give to such\na simple question and looked round at the others as if they were under\nsome obligation to help him, and as if no-one could expect any answer\nfrom him without this help.  Then the usher of the court stepped forward\nto him and, in order to calm him down and raise his spirits, said, \"The\ngentleman here's only asking what it is you're waiting for.  You can\ngive him an answer.\"  The voice of the usher was probably familiar to\nhim, and had a better effect than K.'s.  \"I'm ... I'm waiting ...\" he\nbegan, and then came to a halt.  He had clearly chosen this beginning so\nthat he could give a precise answer to the question, but now he didn't\nknow how to continue.  Some of the others waiting had come closer and\nstood round the group, the usher of the court said to them, \"Get out the\nway, keep the gangway free.\"  They moved back slightly, but not as far\nas where they had been sitting before.  In the meantime, the man whom K.\nhad first approached had pulled himself together and even answered him\nwith a smile.\n\"A month ago I made some applications for evidence to be heard in my\ncase, and I'm waiting for it to be settled.\"  \"You certainly seem to be\ngoing to a lot of effort,\" said K.  \"Yes,\" said the man, \"it is my\naffair after all.\"  \"Not everyone thinks the same way as you do,\" said\nK. \"I've been indicted as well but I swear on my soul that I've neither\nsubmitted evidence nor done anything else of the sort.  Do you really\nthink that's necessary?\"  \"I don't really know, exactly,\" said the man,\nonce more totally unsure of himself; he clearly thought K. was joking\nwith him and therefore probably thought it best to repeat his earlier\nanswer in order to avoid making any new mistakes.  With K. looking at\nhim impatiently, he just said, \"as far as I'm concerned, I've applied to\nhave this evidence heard.\"  \"Perhaps you don't believe I've been\nindicted?\" asked K.  \"Oh, please, I certainly do,\" said the man,\nstepping slightly to one side, but there was more anxiety in his answer\nthan belief.  \"You don't believe me then?\" asked K., and took hold of\nhis arm, unconsciously prompted by the man's humble demeanour, and as if\nhe wanted to force him to believe him.  But he did not want to hurt the\nman and had only taken hold of him very lightly.  Nonetheless, the man\ncried out as if K. had grasped him not with two fingers but with red hot\ntongs.  Shouting in this ridiculous way finally made K. tired of him, if\nhe didn't believe he was indicted then so much the better; maybe he even\nthought K. was a judge.  And before leaving, he held him a lot harder,\nshoved him back onto the bench and walked on.  \"These defendants are so\nsensitive, most of them,\" said the usher of the court.  Almost all of\nthose who had been waiting had now assembled around the man who, by now,\nhad stopped shouting and they seemed to be asking him lots of precise\nquestions about the incident.  K. was approached by a security guard,\nidentifiable mainly by his sword, of which the scabbard seemed to be\nmade of aluminium.  This greatly surprised K., and he reached out for it\nwith his hand.  The guard had come because of the shouting and asked\nwhat had been happening.  The usher of the court said a few words to try\nand calm him down but the guard explained that he had to look into it\nhimself, saluted, and hurried on, walking with very short steps,\nprobably because of gout.\n\n        K. didn't concern himself long with the guard or these people,\nespecially as he saw a turning off the corridor, about half way along it\non the right hand side, where there was no door to stop him going that\nway.  He asked the usher whether that was the right way to go, the usher\nnodded, and that is the way that K. went.  The usher remained always one\nor two steps behind K, which he found irritating as in a place like this\nit could give the impression that he was being driven along by someone\nwho had arrested him, so he frequently waited for the usher to catch up,\nbut the usher always remained behind him.  In order to put an end to his\ndiscomfort, K. finally said, \"Now that I've seen what it looks like\nhere, I'd like to go.\"  \"You haven't seen everything yet,\" said the\nusher ingenuously.\n\"I don't want to see everything,\" said K., who was also feeling very\ntired, \"I want to go, what is the way to the exit?\"  \"You haven't got\nlost, have you?\" asked the usher in amazement, \"you go down this way to\nthe corner, then right down the corridor straight ahead as far as the\ndoor.\"  \"Come with me,\" said K., \"show me the way, I'll miss it, there\nare so many different ways here.\"  \"It's the only way there is,\" said\nthe usher, who had now started to sound quite reproachful, \"I can't go\nback with you again, I've got to hand in my report, and I've already\nlost a lot of time because of you as it is.\"  \"Come with me!\" K.\nrepeated, now somewhat sharper as if he had finally caught the usher out\nin a lie.  \"Don't shout like that,\" whispered the usher, \"there's\noffices all round us here.  If you don't want to go back by yourself\ncome on a bit further with me or else wait here till I've sorted out my\nreport, then I'll be glad to go back with you again.\"  \"No, no,\" said\nK., \"I will not wait and you must come with me now.\"  K. had still not\nlooked round at anything at all in the room where he found himself, and\nit was only when one of the many wooden doors all around him opened that\nhe noticed it.  A young woman, probably summoned by the loudness of K.'s\nvoice, entered and asked, \"What is it the gentleman wants?\"  In the\ndarkness behind her there was also a man approaching.  K. looked at the\nusher.  He had, after all, said that no-one would take any notice of K.,\nand now there were two people coming, it only needed a few and everyone\nin the office would become aware of him and asking for explanations as\nto why he was there.  The only understandable and acceptable thing to\nsay was that he was accused of something and wanted to know the date of\nhis next hearing, but this was an explanation he did not want to give,\nespecially as it was not true - he had only come out of curiosity.  Or\nelse, an explanation even less usable, he could say that he wanted to\nascertain that the court was as revolting on the inside as it was on the\noutside.  And it did seem that he had been quite right in this\nsupposition, he had no wish to intrude any deeper, he was disturbed\nenough by what he had seen already, he was not in the right frame of\nmind just then to face a high official such as might appear from behind\nany door, and he wanted to go, either with the usher of the court or, if\nneeds be, alone.\n\n        But he must have seemed very odd standing there in silence, and\nthe young woman and the usher were indeed looking at him as if they\nthought he would go through some major metamorphosis any second which\nthey didn't want to miss seeing.  And in the doorway stood the man whom\nK. had noticed in the background earlier, he held firmly on to the beam\nabove the low door swinging a little on the tips of his feet as if\nbecoming impatient as he watched.  But the young woman was the first to\nrecognise that K.'s behaviour was caused by his feeling slightly unwell,\nshe brought a chair and asked,\n\"Would you not like to sit down?\"  K. sat down immediately and, in order\nto keep his place better, put his elbows on the armrests.  \"You're a\nlittle bit dizzy, aren't you?\" she asked him.  Her face was now close in\nfront of him, it bore the severe expression that many young women have\njust when they're in the bloom of their youth.  \"It's nothing for you to\nworry about,\" she said, \"that's nothing unusual here, almost everyone\ngets an attack like that the first time they come here.  This is your\nfirst time is it?  Yes, it's nothing unusual then.  The sun burns down\non the roof and the hot wood makes the air so thick and heavy.  It makes\nthis place rather unsuitable for offices, whatever other advantages it\nmight offer.  But the air is almost impossible to breathe on days when\nthere's a lot of business, and that's almost every day.  And when you\nthink that there's a lot of washing put out to dry here as well - and we\ncan't stop the tenants doing that - it's not surprising you started to\nfeel unwell.  But you get used to the air alright in the end.  When\nyou're here for the second or third time you'll hardly notice how\noppressive the air is.  Are you feeling any better now?\"  K. made no\nanswer, he felt too embarrassed at being put at the mercy of these\npeople by his sudden weakness, and learning the reason for feeling ill\nmade him feel not better but a little worse.  The girl noticed it\nstraight away, and to make the air fresher for K., she took a window\npole that was leaning against the wall and pushed open a small hatch\ndirectly above K.'s head that led to the outside.  But so much soot fell\nin that the girl had to immediately close the hatch again and clean the\nsoot off K.'s hands with her handkerchief, as K. was too tired to do\nthat for himself.  He would have liked just to sit quietly where he was\nuntil he had enough strength to leave, and the less fuss people made\nabout him the sooner that would be.  But then the girl said, \"You can't\nstay here, we're in people's way here ...\"  K. looked at her as if to\nask whose way they were impeding.  \"If you like, I can take you to the\nsick room,\" and turning to the man in the doorway said, \"please help\nme\".  The man immediately came over to them, but K. did not want to go\nto the sick room, that was just what he wanted to avoid, being led\nfurther from place to place, the further he went the more difficult it\nmust become.  So he said, \"I am able to walk now,\" and stood up, shaking\nafter becoming used to sitting so comfortably.  But then he was unable\nto stay upright. \"I can't manage it,\" he said shaking his head, and sat\ndown again with a sigh.  He remembered the usher who, despite\neverything, would have been able to lead him out of there but who seemed\nto have gone long before.  K. looked out between the man and the young\nwoman who were standing in front of him but was unable to find the\nusher.  \"I think,\" said the man, who was elegantly dressed and whose\nappearance was made especially impressive with a grey waistcoat that had\ntwo long, sharply tailored points, \"the gentleman is feeling unwell\nbecause of the atmosphere here, so the best thing, and what he would\nmost prefer, would be not to take him to the sick room but get him out\nof the offices altogether.\"  \"That's right,\" exclaimed K., with such joy\nthat he nearly interrupted what the man was saying, \"I'm sure that'll\nmake me feel better straight away, I'm really not that weak, all I need\nis a little support under my arms, I won't cause you much trouble, it's\nnot such a long way anyway, lead me to the door and then I'll sit on the\nstairs for a while and soon recover, as I don't suffer from attacks like\nthis at all, I'm surprised at it myself.  I also work in an office and\nI'm quite used to office air, but here it seems to be too strong, you've\nsaid so yourselves.  So please, be so kind as to help me on my way a\nlittle, I'm feeling dizzy, you see, and it'll make me ill if I stand up\nby myself.\"  And with that he raised his shoulders to make it easier for\nthe two of them to take him by the arms.\n\n        The man, however, didn't follow this suggestion but just stood\nthere with his hands in his trouser pockets and laughed out loud.\n\"There, you see,\" he said to the girl, \"I was quite right.  The\ngentleman is only unwell here, and not in general.\"  The young woman\nsmiled too, but lightly tapped the man's arm with the tips of her\nfingers as if he had allowed himself too much fun with K.  \"So what do\nyou think, then?\" said the man, still laughing, \"I really do want to\nlead the gentleman out of here.\"  \"That's alright, then,\" said the girl,\nbriefly inclining her charming head.  \"Don't worry too much about him\nlaughing,\" said the girl to K., who had become unhappy once more and\nstared quietly in front of himself as if needing no further explanation.\n\"This gentleman - may I introduce you?\" - (the man gave his permission\nwith a wave of the hand) - \"so, this gentleman's job is to give out\ninformation.  He gives all the information they need to people who are\nwaiting, as our court and its offices are not very well known among the\npublic he gets asked for quite a lot.  He has an answer for every\nquestion, you can try him out if you feel like it.  But that's not his\nonly distinction, his other distinction is his elegance of dress.  We,\nthat's to say all of us who work in the offices here, we decided that\nthe information-giver would have to be elegantly dressed as he\ncontinually has to deal with the litigants and he's the first one they\nmeet, so he needs to give a dignified first impression.  The rest of us\nI'm afraid, as you can see just by looking at me, dress very badly and\nold-fashioned; and there's not much point in spending much on clothes\nanyway, as we hardly ever leave the offices, we even sleep here.  But,\nas I said, we decided that the information-giver would have to have nice\nclothes.  As the management here is rather peculiar in this respect, and\nthey would get them for us, we had a collection - some of the litigants\ncontributed too - and bought him these lovely clothes and some others\nbesides.  So everything would be ready for him to give a good\nimpression, except that he spoils it again by laughing and frightening\npeople.\"  \"That's how it is,\" said the man, mocking her, \"but I don't\nunderstand why it is that you're explaining all our intimate facts to\nthe gentleman, or rather why it is that you're pressing them on him, as\nI'm sure he's not all interested.  Just look at him sitting there, it's\nclear he's occupied with his own affairs.\"  K. just did not feel like\ncontradicting him.. The girl's intention may have been good, perhaps she\nwas under instructions to distract him or to give him the chance to\ncollect himself, but the attempt had not worked.  \"I had to explain to\nhim why you were laughing,\" said the girl.  \"I suppose it was\ninsulting.\"  \"I think he would forgive even worse insults if I finally\ntook him outside.\"  K. said nothing, did not even look up, he tolerated\nthe two of them negotiating over him like an object, that was even what\nsuited him best.  But suddenly he felt the information-giver's hand on\none arm and the young woman's hand on the other.  \"Up you get then,\nweakling,\" said the information-giver.  \"Thank you both very much,\" said\nK., pleasantly surprised, as he slowly rose and personally guided these\nunfamiliar hands to the places where he most needed support.\nAs they approached the corridor, the girl said quietly into K.'s ear, \"I\nmust seem to think it's very important to show the information-giver in\na good light, but you shouldn't doubt what I say, I just want to say the\ntruth.  He isn't hard-hearted.  It's not really his job to help\nlitigants outside if they're unwell but he's doing it anyway, as you can\nsee.  I don't suppose any of us is hard-hearted, perhaps we'd all like\nto be helpful, but working for the court offices it's easy for us to\ngive the impression we are hard-hearted and don't want to help anyone.\nIt makes me quite sad.\"  \"Would you not like to sit down here a while?\"\nasked the information-giver, there were already in the corridor and just\nin front of the defendant whom K. had spoken to earlier.  K. felt almost\nashamed to be seen by him, earlier he had stood so upright in front of\nhim and now he had to be supported by two others, his hat was held up by\nthe information-giver balanced on outstretched fingers, his hair was\ndishevelled and hung down onto the sweat on his forehead.  But the\ndefendant seemed to notice nothing of what was going on and just stood\nthere humbly, as if wanting to apologise to the information-giver for\nbeing there. The information-giver looked past him.  \"I know,\" he said,\n\"that my case can't be settled today, not yet, but I've come in anyway,\nI thought, I thought I could wait here anyway, it's Sunday today, I've\ngot plenty of time, and I'm not disturbing anyone here.\"  \"There's no\nneed to be so apologetic,\" said the information-giver, \"it's very\ncommendable for you to be so attentive.  You are taking up space here\nwhen you don't need to but as long as you don't get in my way I will do\nnothing to stop you following the progress of your case as closely as\nyou like.  When one has seen so many people who shamefully neglect their\ncases one learns to show patience with people like you.   Do sit down.\"\n\"He's very good with the litigants,\" whispered the girl.  K. nodded, but\nstarted to move off again when the information-giver repeated, \"Would\nyou not like to sit down here a while?\"  \"No,\" said K., \"I don't want to\nrest.\"  He had said that as decisively as he could, but in fact it\nwould have done him a lot of good to sit down.  It was as if he were\nsuffering sea-sickness.  He felt as if he were on a ship in a rough sea,\nas if the water were hitting against the wooden walls, a thundering from\nthe depths of the corridor as if the torrent were crashing over it, as\nif the corridor were swaying and the waiting litigants on each side of\nit rising and sinking.  It made the calmness of the girl and the man\nleading him all the more incomprehensible.  He was at their mercy, if\nthey let go of him he would fall like a board.  Their little eyes\nglanced here and there, K. could feel the evenness of their steps but\ncould not do the same, as from step to step he was virtually being\ncarried.  He finally noticed they were speaking to him but he did not\nunderstand them, all he heard was a noise that filled all the space and\nthrough which there seemed to be an unchanging higher note sounding,\nlike a siren.  \"Louder,\" he whispered with his head sunk low, ashamed at\nhaving to ask them to speak louder when he knew they had spoken loudly\nenough, even if it had been, for him, incomprehensible.  At last, a\ndraught of cool air blew in his face as if a gap had been torn out in\nthe wall in front of him, and next to him he heard someone say, \"First\nhe says he wants to go, and then you can tell him a hundred times that\nthis is the way out and he doesn't move.\"  K. became aware that he was\nstanding in front of the way out, and that the young woman had opened\nthe door.  It seemed to him that all his strength returned to him at\nonce, and to get a foretaste of freedom he stepped straight on to one of\nthe stairs and took his leave there of his companions, who bowed to him.\n\"Thank you very much,\" he repeated, shook their hands once more and did\nnot let go until he thought he saw that they found it hard to bear the\ncomparatively fresh air from the stairway after being so long used to\nthe air in the offices.  They were hardly able to reply, and the young\nwoman might even have fallen over if K. had not shut the door extremely\nfast.  K. then stood still for a while, combed his hair with the help of\na pocket mirror, picked up his hat from the next stair - the\ninformation-giver must have thrown it down there - and then he ran down\nthe steps so fresh and in such long leaps that the contrast with his\nprevious state nearly frightened him.  His normally sturdy state of\nhealth had never prepared him for surprises such as this.  Did his body\nwant to revolt and cause him a new trial as he was bearing the old one\nwith such little effort?  He did not quite reject the idea that he\nshould see a doctor the next time he had the chance, but whatever he did\n- and this was something on which he could advise himself - he wanted to\nspend all Sunday mornings in future better than he had spent this one.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Four\nMiss Buerstner's Friend\n\n        For some time after this, K. found it impossible to exchange even\njust a few words with Miss Buerstner.  He tried to reach her in many and\nvarious ways but she always found a way to avoid it.  He would come\nstraight home from the office, remain in her room without the light on,\nand sit on the sofa with nothing more to distract him than keeping watch\non the empty hallway.  If the maid went by and closed the door of the\napparently empty room he would get up after a while and open it again.\nHe got up an hour earlier than usual in the morning so that he might\nperhaps find Miss Buerstner alone as she went to the office.  But none of\nthese efforts brought any success.  Then he wrote her a letter, both to\nthe office and the flat, attempting once more to justify his behaviour,\noffered to make whatever amends he could, promised never to cross\nwhatever boundary she might set him and begged merely to have the chance\nto speak to her some time, especially as he was unable to do anything\nwith Mrs. Grubach either until he had spoken with Miss Buerstner, he\nfinally informed her that the following Sunday he would stay in his room\nall day waiting for a sign from her that there was some hope of his\nrequest being fulfilled, or at least that she would explain to him why\nshe could not fulfil it even though he had promised to observe whatever\nstipulations she might make.  The letters were not returned, but there\nwas no answer either.  However, on the following Sunday there was a sign\nthat seemed clear enough.  It was still early when K. noticed, through\nthe keyhole, that there was an unusual level of activity in the hallway\nwhich soon abated.  A French teacher, although she was German and called\nMontag, a pale and febrile girl with a slight limp who had previously\noccupied a room of her own, was moving into Miss Buerstner's room.  She\ncould be seen shuffling through the hallway for several hours, there was\nalways another piece of clothing or a blanket or a book that she had\nforgotten and had to be fetched specially and brought into the new home.\n\n        When Mrs. Grubach brought K. his breakfast - ever since the time\nwhen she had made K. so cross she didn't trust the maid to do the\nslightest job - he had no choice but to speak to her, for the first time\nin five days.  \"Why is there so much noise in the hallway today?\" he\nasked as she poured his coffee out, \"Can't something be done about it?\nDoes this clearing out have to be done on a Sunday?\"  K. did not look up\nat Mrs. Grubach, but he saw nonetheless that she seemed to feel some\nrelief as she breathed in.  Even sharp questions like this from Mr. K.\nshe perceived as forgiveness, or as the beginning of forgiveness.\n\"We're not clearing anything out, Mr. K.,\" she said, \"it's just that\nMiss Montag is moving in with Miss Buerstner and is moving her things\nacross.\"  She said nothing more, but just waited to see how K. would\ntake it and whether he would allow her to carry on speaking.  But K.\nkept her in uncertainty, took the spoon and pensively stirred his coffee\nwhile he remained silent.  Then he looked up at her and said, \"What\nabout the suspicions you had earlier about Miss Buerstner, have you given\nthem up?\"  \"Mr. K.,\" called Mrs. Grubach, who had been waiting for this\nvery question, as she put her hands together and held them out towards\nhim.  \"I just made a chance remark and you took it so badly.  I didn't\nhave the slightest intention of offending anyone, not you or anyone\nelse.  You've known me for long enough, Mr. K., I'm sure you're\nconvinced of that.  You don't know how I've been suffering for the past\nfew days!  That I should tell lies about my tenants!  And you, Mr. K.,\nyou believed it!  And said I should give you notice!  Give you notice!\"\nAt this last outcry, Mrs. Grubach was already choking back her tears,\nshe raised her apron to her face and blubbered out loud.\n\n        \"Oh, don't cry Mrs. Grubach,\" said K., looking out the window, he\nwas thinking only of Miss Buerstner and how she was accepting an unknown\ngirl into her room.  \"Now don't cry,\" he said again as he turned his\nlook back into the room where Mrs. Grubach was still crying.  \"I meant\nno harm either when I said that.  It was simply a misunderstanding\nbetween us.  That can happen even between old friends sometimes.\"  Mrs.\nGrubach pulled her apron down to below her eyes to see whether K. really\nwas attempting a reconciliation.  \"Well, yes, that's how it is,\" said\nK., and as Mrs. Grubach's behaviour indicated that the captain had said\nnothing he dared to add, \"Do you really think, then, that I'd want to\nmake an enemy of you for the sake of a girl we hardly know?\" \"Yes,\nyou're quite right, Mr. K.,\" said Mrs. Grubach, and then, to her\nmisfortune, as soon as she felt just a little freer to speak, she added\nsomething rather inept.  \"I kept asking myself why it was that Mr. K.\ntook such an interest in Miss Buerstner.  Why does he quarrel with me\nover her when he knows that any cross word from him and I can't sleep\nthat night?  And I didn't say anything about Miss Buerstner that I hadn't\nseen with my own eyes.\"  K. said nothing in reply, he should have chased\nher from the room as soon as she had opened her mouth, and he didn't\nwant to do that.  He contented himself with merely drinking his coffee\nand letting Mrs. Grubach feel that she was superfluous.  Outside, the\ndragging steps of Miss Montag could still be heard as she went from one\nside of the hallway to the other.  \"Do you hear that?\" asked K. pointing\nhis hand at the door.  \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Grubach with a sigh, \"I wanted\nto give her some help and I wanted the maid to help her too but she's\nstubborn, she wants to move everything in herself.  I wonder at Miss\nBuerstner.  I often feel it's a burden for me to have Miss Montag as a\ntenant but Miss Buerstner accepts her into her room with herself.\"\n\"There's nothing there for you to worry about\" said K., crushing the\nremains of a sugar lump in his cup.  \"Does she cause you any trouble?\"\n\"No,\" said Mrs. Grubach, \"in itself it's very good to have her there, it\nmakes another room free for me and I can let my nephew, the captain,\noccupy it.  I began to worry he might be disturbing you when I had to\nlet him live in the living room next to you over the last few days.\nHe's not very considerate.\"  \"What an idea!\" said K. standing up,\n\"there's no question of that.  You seem to think that because I can't\nstand this to-ing and fro-ing of Miss Montag that I'm over-sensitive -\nand there she goes back again.\"  Mrs. Grubach appeared quite powerless.\n\"Should I tell her to leave moving the rest of her things over till\nlater, then, Mr. K.?  If that's what you want I'll do it immediately.\"\n\"But she has to move in with Miss Buerstner!\" said K.  \"Yes,\" said Mrs.\nGrubach, without quite understanding what K. meant.  \"So she has to take\nher things over there.\"  Mrs. Grubach just nodded.  K. was irritated all\nthe more by this dumb helplessness which, seen from the outside, could\nhave seemed like a kind of defiance on her part.  He began to walk up\nand down the room between the window and the door, thus depriving Mrs.\nGrubach of the chance to leave, which she otherwise probably would have\ndone.\n\n        Just as K. once more reached the door, someone knocked at it.  It\nwas the maid, to say that Miss Montag would like to have a few words\nwith Mr. K., and therefore requested that he come to the dining room\nwhere she was waiting for him.  K. heard the maid out thoughtfully, and\nthen looked back at the shocked Mrs. Grubach in a way that was almost\ncontemptuous.  His look seemed to be saying that K. had been expecting\nthis invitation for Miss Montag for a long time, and that it was\nconfirmation of the suffering he had been made to endure that Sunday\nmorning from Mrs. Grubach's tenants.  He sent the maid back with the\nreply that he was on his way, then he went to the wardrobe to change his\ncoat, and in answer to Mrs. Grubach's gentle whining about the nuisance\nMiss Montag was causing merely asked her to clear away the breakfast\nthings.  \"But you've hardly touched it,\" said Mrs. Grubach.  \"Oh just\ntake it away!\" shouted K.  It seemed to him that Miss Montag was mixed\nup in everything and made it repulsive to him.\n\n        As he went through the hallway he looked at the closed door of\nMiss Buerstner's room.  But it wasn't there that he was invited, but the\ndining room, to which he yanked the door open without knocking.\n\n        The room was long but narrow with one window.  There was only\nenough space available to put two cupboards at an angle in the corner by\nthe door, and the rest of the room was entirely taken up with the long\ndining table which started by the door and reached all the way to the\ngreat window, which was thus made almost inaccessible.  The table was\nalready laid for a large number of people, as on Sundays almost all the\ntenants ate their dinner here at midday.\n\n        When K. entered, Miss Montag came towards him from the window\nalong one side of the table.  They greeted each other in silence.  Then\nMiss Montag, her head unusually erect as always, said, \"I'm not sure\nwhether you know me.\"  K. looked at her with a frown.  \"Of course I do,\"\nhe said, \"you've been living here with Mrs. Grubach for quite some time\nnow.\"  \"But I get the impression you don't pay much attention to what's\ngoing on in the lodging house,\"  said Miss Montag.  \"No,\" said K.\n\"Would you not like to sit down?\" said Miss Montag.  In silence, the two\nof them drew chairs out from the farthest end of the table and sat down\nfacing each other.  But Miss Montag stood straight up again as she had\nleft her handbag on the window sill and went to fetch it; she shuffled\ndown the whole length of the room.  When she came back, the handbag\nlightly swinging, she said, \"I'd like just to have a few words with you\non behalf of my friend.  She would have come herself, but she's feeling\na little unwell today.  Perhaps you'll be kind enough to forgive her and\nlisten to me instead.  There's anyway nothing that she could have said\nthat I won't.  On the contrary, in fact, I think I can say even more\nthan her because I'm relatively impartial.  Would you not agree?\"  \"What\nis there to say, then?\" answered K., who was tired of Miss Montag\ncontinuously watching his lips.  In that way she took control of what he\nwanted to say before he said it.  \"Miss Buerstner clearly refuses to\ngrant me the personal meeting that I asked her for.\"  \"That's how it\nis,\" said Miss Montag, \"or rather, that's not at all how it is, the way\nyou put it is remarkably severe.  Generally speaking, meetings are\nneither granted nor the opposite.  But it can be that meetings are\nconsidered unnecessary, and that's how it is here.  Now, after your\ncomment, I can speak openly.  You asked my friend, verbally or in\nwriting, for the chance to speak with her.  Now my friend is aware of\nyour reasons for asking for this meeting - or at least I suppose she is\n- and so, for reasons I know nothing about, she is quite sure that it\nwould be of no benefit to anyone if this meeting actually took place.\nMoreover, it was only yesterday, and only very briefly, that she made it\nclear to me that such a meeting could be of no benefit for yourself\neither, she feels that it can only have been a matter of chance that\nsuch an idea came to you, and that even without any explanations from\nher, you will very soon come to realise yourself, if you have not done\nso already, the futility of your idea.  My answer to that is that\nalthough it may be quite right, I consider it advantageous, if the\nmatter is to be made perfectly clear, to give you an explicit answer.  I\noffered my services in taking on the task, and after some hesitation my\nfriend conceded.  I hope, however, also to have acted in your interests,\nas even the slightest uncertainty in the least significant of matters\nwill always remain a cause of suffering and if, as in this case, it can\nbe removed without substantial effort, then it is better if that is done\nwithout delay.\"  \"I thank you,\" said K. as soon as Miss Montag had\nfinished.  He stood slowly up, looked at her, then across the table,\nthen out the window - the house opposite stood there in the sun - and\nwent to the door.  Miss Montag followed him a few paces, as if she did\nnot quite trust him.  At the door, however, both of them had to step\nback as it opened and Captain Lanz entered.  This was the first time\nthat K. had seen him close up.  He was a large man of about forty with a\ntanned, fleshy face.  He bowed slightly, intending it also for K., and\nthen went over to Miss Montag and deferentially kissed her hand.  He was\nvery elegant in the way he moved. The courtesy he showed towards Miss\nMontag made a striking contrast with the way she had been treated by K.\nNonetheless, Miss Montag did not seem to be cross with K. as it even\nseemed to him that she wanted to introduce the captain.  K. however, did\nnot want to be introduced, he would not have been able to show any sort\nof friendliness either to Miss Montag or to the captain, the kiss on the\nhand had, for K., bound them into a group which would keep him at a\ndistance from Miss Buerstner whilst at the same time seeming to be\ntotally harmless and unselfish.  K. thought, however, that he saw more\nthan that, he thought he also saw that Miss Montag had chosen a means of\ndoing it that was good, but two-edged.  She exaggerated the importance\nof the relationship between K. and Miss Buerstner, and above all she\nexaggerated the importance of asking to speak with her and she tried at\nthe same time to make out that K. was exaggerating everything.  She\nwould be disappointed, K. did not want to exaggerate anything, he was\naware that Miss Buerstner was a little typist who would not offer him\nmuch resistance for long.  In doing so he deliberately took no account\nof what Mrs. Grubach had told him about Miss Buerstner.  All these things\nwere going through his mind as he left the room with hardly a polite\nword.  He wanted to go straight to his room, but a little laugh from\nMiss Montag that he heard from the dining room behind him brought him to\nthe idea that he might prepare a  surprise for the two of them, the\ncaptain and Miss Montag.  He looked round and listened to find out if\nthere might be any disturbance from any of the surrounding rooms,\neverywhere was quiet, the only thing to be heard was the conversation\nfrom the dining room and Mrs. Grubach's voice from the passage leading\nto the kitchen.  This seemed an opportune time, K. went to Miss\nBuerstner's room and knocked gently.  There was no sound so he knocked\nagain but there was still no answer in reply.  Was she asleep?  Or was\nshe really unwell?  Or was she just pretending as she realised it could\nonly be K. knocking so gently?  K. assumed she was pretending and\nknocked harder, eventually, when the knocking brought no result, he\ncarefully opened the door with the sense of doing something that was not\nonly improper but also pointless.  In the room there was no-one.  What's\nmore, it looked hardly at all like the room K. had known before.\nAgainst the wall there were now two beds behind one another, there were\nclothes piled up on three chairs near the door, a wardrobe stood open.\nMiss Buerstner must have gone out while Miss Montag was speaking to him\nin the dining room.  K. was not greatly bothered by this, he had hardly\nexpected to be able to find Miss Buerstner so easily and had made this\nattempt for little more reason than to spite Miss Montag.  But that made\nit all the more embarrassing for him when, as he was closing the door\nagain, he saw Miss Montag and the captain talking in the open doorway of\nthe dining room.  They had probably been standing there ever since K.\nhad opened the door, they avoided seeming to observe K. but chatted\nlightly and followed his movements with glances, the absent minded\nglances to the side such as you make during a conversation.  But these\nglances were heavy for K., and he rushed alongside the wall back into\nhis own room.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Five\nThe whip-man\n\n        One evening, a few days later, K. was walking along one of the\ncorridors that separated his office from the main stairway - he was\nnearly the last one to leave for home that evening, there remained only\na couple of workers in the light of a single bulb in the dispatch\ndepartment - when he heard a sigh from behind a door which he had\nhimself never opened but which he had always thought just led into a\njunk room.  He stood in amazement and listened again to establish\nwhether he might not be mistaken.  For a while there was silence, but\nthen came some more sighs.  His first thought was to fetch one of the\nservitors, it might well have been worth having a witness present, but\nthen he was taken by an uncontrollable curiosity that make him simply\nyank the door open.  It was, as he had thought, a junk room.  Old,\nunusable forms, empty stone ink-bottles lay scattered behind the\nentrance.  But in the cupboard-like room itself stood three men,\ncrouching under the low ceiling.  A candle fixed on a shelf gave them\nlight.  \"What are you doing here?\" asked K. quietly, but crossly and\nwithout thinking.  One of the men was clearly in charge, and attracted\nattention by being dressed in a kind of dark leather costume which left\nhis neck and chest and his arms exposed.  He did not answer.  But the\nother two called out, \"Mr. K.!  We're to be beaten because you made a\ncomplaint about us to the examining judge.\"  And now, K. finally\nrealised that it was actually the two policemen, Franz and Willem, and\nthat the third man held a cane in his hand with which to beat them.\n\"Well,\" said K., staring at them, \"I didn't make any complaint, I only\nsaid what took place in my home.  And your behaviour was not entirely\nunobjectionable, after all.\"  \"Mr. K.,\" said Willem, while Franz clearly\ntried to shelter behind him as protection from the third man, \"if you\nknew how badly we get paid you wouldn't think so badly of us.  I've got\na family to feed, and Franz here wanted to get married, you just have to\nget more money where you can, you can't do it just by working hard, not\nhowever hard you try.  I was sorely tempted by your fine clothes,\npolicemen aren't allowed to do that sort of thing, course they aren't,\nand it wasn't right of us, but it's tradition that the clothes go to the\nofficers, that's how it's always been, believe me; and it's\nunderstandable too, isn't it, what can things like that mean for anyone\nunlucky enough to be arrested?  But if he starts talking about it openly\nthen the punishment has to follow.\"  \"I didn't know about any of this\nthat you've been telling me, and I made no sort of request that you be\npunished, I was simply acting on principle.\"  \"Franz,\" said Willem,\nturning to the other policeman, \"didn't I tell you that the gentleman\ndidn't say he wanted us to be punished?  Now you can hear for yourself,\nhe didn't even know we'd have to be punished.\"  \"Don't you let them\npersuade you, talking like that,\" said the third man to K., \"this\npunishment is both just and unavoidable.\"  \"Don't listen to him,\" said\nWillem, interrupting himself only to quickly bring his hand to his mouth\nwhen it had received a stroke of the cane, \"we're only being punished\nbecause you made a complaint against us.  Nothing would have happened to\nus otherwise, not even if they'd found out what we'd done.  Can you call\nthat justice?  Both of us, me especially, we'd proved our worth as good\npolice officers over a long period - you've got to admit yourself that\nas far as official work was concerned we did the job well - things\nlooked good for us, we had prospects, it's quite certain that we\nwould've been made whip-men too, like this one, only he had the luck not\nto have anyone make a complaint about him, as you really don't get many\ncomplaints like that.  Only that's all finished now, Mr. K., our careers\nare at an end, we're going to have to do work now that's far inferior to\npolice work and besides all this we're going to get this terrible,\npainful beating.\"  \"Can the cane really cause so much pain, then?\" asked\nK., testing the cane that the whip-man swang in front of him.  \"We're\ngoing to have to strip off totally naked,\" said Willem.  \"Oh, I see,\"\nsaid K., looking straight at the whip-man, his skin was burned brown\nlike a sailor's, and his face showed health and vigour.  \"Is there\nthen no possibility of sparing these two their beating?\" he asked him.\n\"No,\" said the whip-man, shaking his head with a laugh.  \"Get\nundressed!\" he ordered the policemen.  And to K. he said, \"You shouldn't\nbelieve everything they tell you, it's the fear of being beaten, it's\nalready made them a bit weak in the head.  This one here, for instance,\"\nhe pointed at Willem, \"all that he told you about his career prospects,\nit's just ridiculous.  Look at him, look how fat he is - the first\nstrokes of the cane will just get lost in all that fat.   Do you know\nwhat it is that's made him so fat?  He's in the habit of, everyone that\ngets arrested by him, he eats their breakfast.  Didn't he eat up your\nbreakfast?  Yeah, I thought as much.  But a man with a belly like that\ncan't be made into a whip-man and never will be, that is quite out of\nthe question.\"  \"There are whip-men like that,\" Willem insisted, who had\njust released the belt of this trousers.  \"No,\" said the whip-man,\nstriking him such a blow with the cane on his neck that it made him\nwince, \"you shouldn't be listening to this, just get undressed.\"  \"I\nwould make it well worth your while if you would let them go,\" said K.,\nand without looking at the whip-man again - as such matters are best\ncarried on with both pairs of eyes turned down - he pulled out his\nwallet.  \"And then you'd try and put in a complaint against me, too,\"\nsaid the whip-man, \"and get me flogged.  No, no!\"  \"Now, do be\nreasonable,\" said K., \"if I had wanted to get these two punished I would\nnot now be trying to buy their freedom, would I.  I could simply close\nthe door here behind me, go home and see or hear nothing more of it.\nBut that's not what I'm doing, it really is of much more importance to\nme to let them go free; if I had realised they would be punished, or\neven that they might be punished, I would never have named them in the\nfirst place as they are not the ones I hold responsible.  It's the\norganisation that's to blame, the high officials are the ones to blame.\"\n\"That's how it is!\" shouted the policemen, who then immediately received\nanother blow on their backs, which were by now exposed.  \"If you had a\nsenior judge here beneath your stick,\" said K., pressing down the cane\nas he spoke to stop it being raised once more, \"I really would do\nnothing to stop you, on the contrary, I would even pay you money to give\nyou all the more strength.\"  \"Yeah, that's all very plausible, what\nyou're saying there,\" said the whip-man, \"only I'm not the sort of\nperson you can bribe.  It's my job to flog people, so I flog them.\"\nFranz, the policeman, had been fairly quiet so far, probably in\nexpectation of a good result from K.'s intervention, but now he stepped\nforward to the door wearing just his trousers, kneeled down hanging on\nto K.'s arm and whispered, \"Even if you can't get mercy shown for both\nof us, at least try and get me set free.  Willem is older than me, he's\nless sensitive than me in every way, he even got a light beating a\ncouple of years ago, but my record's still clean, I only did things the\nway I did because Willem led me on to it, he's been my teacher both for\ngood and bad.  Down in front of the bank my poor bride is waiting for me\nat the entrance, I'm so ashamed of myself, it's pitiful.\"  His face was\nflowing over with tears, and he wiped it dry on K.'s coat.  \"I'm not\ngoing to wait any longer,\" said the whip-man, taking hold of the cane in\nboth hands and laying in to Franz while Willem cowered back in a corner\nand looked on secretly, not even daring to turn his head.  Then, the\nsudden scream that shot out from Franz was long and irrevocable, it\nseemed to come not from a human being but from an instrument that was\nbeing tortured, the whole corridor rang with it, it must have been heard\nby everyone in the building.  \"Don't shout like that!\", called out K.,\nunable to prevent himself, and, as he looked anxiously in the direction\nfrom which the servitor would come, he gave Franz a shove, not hard, but\nhard enough for him to fall down unconscious, clawing at the ground with\nhis hands by reflex; he still did not avoid being hit; the rod still\nfound him on the floor; the tip of the rod swang regularly up and down\nwhile he rolled to and fro under its blows.  And now one of the\nservitors appeared in the distance, with another a few steps behind him.\nK. had quickly thrown the door shut, gone over to one of the windows\noverlooking the yard and opened it.  The screams had completely stopped.\nSo that the servitor wouldn't come in, he called out, \"It's only me!\"\n\"Good evening, chief clerk,\" somebody called back.  \"Is there anything\nwrong?\"  \"No, no,\" answered K., \"it's only a dog yelping in the yard.\"\nThere was no sound from the servitors so he added, \"You can go back to\nwhat you were doing.\"  He did not want to become involved with a\nconversation with them, and so he leant out of the window.  A little\nwhile later, when he looked out in the corridor, they had already gone.\nNow, K. remained at the window, he did not dare go back into the junk\nroom, and he did not want to go home either.  The yard he looked down\ninto was small and rectangular, all around it were offices, all the\nwindows were now dark and only those at the very top caught a reflection\nof the moon.  K tried hard to see into the darkness of one corner of the\nyard, where a few handcarts had been left behind one another. He felt\nanguish at not having been able to prevent the flogging, but that was\nnot his fault, if Franz had not screamed like that - clearly it must\nhave caused a great deal of pain but it's important to maintain control\nof oneself at important moments - if Franz had not screamed then it was\nat least highly probable that K. would have been able to dissuade the\nwhip-man.  If all the junior officers were contemptible why would the\nwhip-man, whose position was the most inhumane of all, be any exception,\nand K. had noticed very clearly how his eyes had lit up when he saw the\nbanknotes, he had obviously only seemed serious about the flogging to\nraise the level of the bribe a little. And K. had not been ungenerous,\nhe really had wanted to get the policemen freed; if he really had now\nbegun to do something against  the degeneracy of the court then it was a\nmatter of course that he would have to do something here as well.  But\nof course, it became impossible for him to do anything as soon as Franz\nstarted screaming.  K. could not possibly have let the junior bank\nstaff, and perhaps even all sorts of other people, come along and catch\nhim by surprise as he haggled with those people in the junk room.\nNobody could really expect that sort of sacrifice of him.  If that had\nbeen his intention then it would almost have been easier, K. would have\ntaken his own clothes off and offered himself to the whip-man in the\npolicemen's place.  The whip-man would certainly not have accepted this\nsubstitution anyway, as in that way he would have seriously violated his\nduty without gaining any benefit.  He would most likely have violated\nhis duty twice over, as court employees were probably under orders not\nto cause any harm to K. while he was facing charges, although there may\nhave been special conditions in force here.  However things stood, K.\nwas able to do no more than throw the door shut, even though that would\nstill do nothing to remove all the dangers he faced.  It was regrettable\nthat he had given Franz a shove, and it could only be excused by the\nheat of the moment.\n\n        In the distance, he heard the steps of the servitors; he did not\nwant them to be too aware of his presence, so he closed the window and\nwalked towards the main staircase.  At the door of the junk room he\nstopped and listened for a little while.  All was silent.  The two\npolicemen were entirely at the whip-man's mercy; he could have beaten\nthem to death.  K. reached his hand out for the door handle but drew it\nsuddenly back.  He was no longer in any position to help anyone, and the\nservitors would soon be back;  he did, though, promise himself that he\nwould raise the matter again with somebody and see that, as far as it\nwas in his power, those who really were guilty, the high officials whom\nnobody had so far dared point out to him, received their due punishment.\nAs he went down the main stairway at the front of the bank,  he looked\ncarefully round at everyone who was passing, but there was no girl to be\nseen who might have been waiting for somebody, not even within some\ndistance from the bank.  Franz's claim that his bride was waiting for\nhim was thus shown to be a lie, albeit one that was forgivable and\nintended only to elicit more sympathy.\n\n        The policemen were still on K.'s mind all through the following\nday; he was unable to concentrate on his work and had to stay in his\noffice a little longer than the previous day so that he could finish it.\nOn the way home, as he passed by the junk room again, he opened its door\nas if that had been his habit.  Instead of the darkness he expected, he\nsaw everything unchanged from the previous evening, and did not know how\nhe should respond.  Everything was exactly the same as he had seen it\nwhen he had opened the door the previous evening.   The forms and\nbottles of ink just inside the doorway, the whip-man with his cane, the\ntwo policemen, still undressed, the candle on the shelf, and the two\npolicemen began to wail and call out \"Mr. K.!\"  K. slammed the door\nimmediately shut, and even thumped on it with his fists as if that would\nshut it all the firmer.  Almost in tears, he ran to the servitors\nworking quietly at the copying machine.  \"Go and get that junk room\ncleared out!\" he shouted, and, in amazement, they stopped what they were\ndoing. \"It should have been done long ago, we're sinking in dirt!\"  They\nwould be able to do the job the next day, K. nodded, it was too late in\nthe evening to make them do it there and then as he had originally\nintended.  He sat down briefly in order to keep them near him for a\nlittle longer, looked through a few of the copies to give the impression\nthat he was checking them and then, as he saw that they would not dare\nto leave at the same time as himself, went home tired and with his mind\nnumb.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Six\nK.'s uncle - Leni\n\n        One afternoon - K. was very busy at the time, getting the post\nready - K.'s Uncle Karl, a small country land owner, came into the room,\npushing his way between two of the staff who were bringing in some\npapers.   K. had long expected his uncle to appear, but the sight of him\nnow shocked K. far less than the prospect of it had done a long time\nbefore.  His uncle was bound to come, K. had been sure of that for about\na month.  He already thought at the time he could see how his uncle\nwould arrive, slightly bowed, his battered panama hat in his left hand,\nhis right hand already stretched out over the desk long before he was\nclose enough as he rushed carelessly towards K. knocking over everything\nthat was in his way.  K.'s uncle was always in a hurry, as he suffered\nfrom the unfortunate belief that he had a number things to do while he\nwas in the big city and had to settle all of them in one day - his\nvisits were only ever for one day - and at the same time thought he\ncould not forgo any conversation or piece of business or pleasure that\nmight arise by chance.  Uncle Karl was K.'s former guardian, and so K.\nwas duty-bound to help him in all of this as well as to offer him a bed\nfor the night.  'I'm haunted by a ghost from the country', he would say.\n\n        As soon as they had greeted each other - K. had invited him to sit\nin the armchair but Uncle Karl had no time for that - he said he wanted\nto speak briefly with K. in private.  \"It is necessary,\" he said with a\ntired gulp, \"it is necessary for my peace of mind.\"   K. immediately\nsent the junior staff from the room and told them to let no-one in.\n\"What's this that I've been hearing, Josef?\" cried K.'s uncle when they\nwere alone, as he sat on the table shoving various papers under himself\nwithout looking at them to make himself more comfortable.  K. said\nnothing, he knew what was coming, but, suddenly relieved from the effort\nof the work he had been doing, he gave way to a pleasant lassitude and\nlooked out the window at the other side of the street.  From where he\nsat, he could see just a small, triangular section of it, part of the\nempty walls of houses between two shop windows.  \"You're staring out the\nwindow!\" called out his uncle, raising his arms, \"For God's sake, Josef,\ngive me an answer!  Is it true, can it really be true?\"  \"Uncle Karl,\"\nsaid K., wrenching himself back from his daydreaming, \"I really don't\nknow what it is you want of me.\"  \"Josef,\" said his uncle in a warning\ntone, \"as far as I know, you've always told the truth.  Am I to take\nwhat you've just said as a bad sign?\"  \"I think I know what it is you\nwant,\" said K. obediently, \"I expect you've heard about my trial.\"\n\"That's right,\" answered his uncle with a slow nod, \"I've heard about\nyour trial.\"  \"Who did you hear it from, then?\" asked K.  \"Erna wrote to\nme,\" said his uncle, \"she doesn't have much contact with you, it's true,\nyou don't pay very much attention to her, I'm afraid to say, but she\nlearned about it nonetheless.  I got her letter today and, of course, I\ncame straight here.  And for no other reason, but it seems to me that\nthis is reason enough.  I can read you out the part of the letter that\nconcerns you.\"  He drew the letter out from his wallet.  \"Here it is.\nShe writes; 'I have not seen Josef for a long time, I was in the bank\nlast week but Josef was so busy that they would not let me through; I\nwaited there for nearly an hour but then I had to go home as I had my\npiano lesson.  I would have liked to have spoken to him, maybe there\nwill be a chance another time.  He sent me a big box of chocolates for\nmy name-day, that was very nice and attentive of him.  I forgot to tell\nyou about it when I wrote, and I only remember now that you ask me about\nit.  Chocolate, as I am sure you are aware, disappears straight away in\nthis lodging house, almost as soon as you know somebody has given you\nchocolate it is gone.  But there is something else I wanted to tell you\nabout Josef.  Like I said, they would not let me through to see him at\nthe bank because he was negotiating with some gentleman just then.\nAfter I had been waiting quietly for quite a long time I asked one of\nthe staff whether his meeting would last much longer.  He said it might\nwell do, as it was probably about the legal proceedings, he said, that\nwere being conducted against him.   I asked what sort of legal\nproceedings it was that were being conducted against the chief clerk,\nand whether he was not making some mistake, but he said he was not\nmaking any mistake, there were legal proceedings underway and even that\nthey were about something quite serious, but he did not know any more\nabout it.   He would have liked to have been of some help to the chief\nclerk himself, as the chief clerk was a gentleman, good and honest, but\nhe did not know what it was he could do and merely hoped there would be\nsome influential gentlemen who would take his side.  I'm sure that is\nwhat will happen and that everything will turn out for the best in the\nend, but in the mean time things do not look at all good, and you can\nsee that from the mood of the chief clerk himself.  Of course, I did not\nplace too much importance on this conversation, and even did my best to\nput the bank clerk's mind at rest, he was quite a simple man.  I told\nhim he was not to speak to anyone else about this, and I think it is all\njust a rumour, but I still think it might be good if you, Dear Father,\nif you looked into the matter the next time you visit.   It will be easy\nfor you to find out more detail and, if it is really necessary, to do\nsomething about it through the great and influential people you know.\nBut if it is not necessary, and that is what seems most likely, then at\nleast your daughter will soon have the chance to embrace you and I look\nforward to it.' - She's a good child,\" said K.'s uncle when he had\nfinished reading, and wiped a few tears from his eyes.  K. nodded.  With\nall the different disruptions he had had recently he had completely\nforgotten about Erna, even her birthday, and the story of the chocolates\nhad clearly just been invented so that he wouldn't get in trouble with\nhis aunt and uncle.  It was very touching, and even the theatre tickets,\nwhich he would regularly send her from then on, would not be enough to\nrepay her,  but he really did not feel, now, that it was right for him\nto visit her in her lodgings and hold conversations with a little,\neighteen year old schoolgirl.  \"And what do you have to say about that?\"\nasked his uncle, who had forgotten all his rush and excitement as he read\nthe letter, and seemed to be about to read it again.  \"Yes, Uncle,\" said\nK., \"it is true.\"  \"True!\" called out his uncle. \"What is true?  How can\nthis be true?  What sort of trial is it?  Not a criminal trial, I hope?\"\n\"It's a criminal trial,\" answered K.  \"And you sit quietly here while\nyou've got a criminal trial round your neck?\" shouted his uncle, getting\never louder.  \"The more calm I am, the better it will be for the\noutcome,\" said K. in a tired voice, \"don't worry.\"  \"How can I help\nworrying?!\" shouted his uncle, \"Josef, my Dear Josef, think about\nyourself, about your family, think about our good name!  Up till now,\nyou've always been our pride, don't now become our disgrace.  I don't\nlike the way you're behaving,\" he said, looking at K. with his head at\nan angle, \"that's not how an innocent man behaves when he's accused of\nsomething, not if he's still got any strength in him.  Just tell me what\nit's all about so that I can help you.  It's something to do with the\nbank, I take it?\"  \"No,\" said K. as he stood up, \"and you're speaking\ntoo loud, Uncle, I expect one of the staff is listening at the door and\nI find that rather unpleasant.  It's best if we go somewhere else, then\nI can answer all your questions, as far as I can.  And I know very well\nthat I have to account to the family for what I do.\"  \"You certainly\ndo!\" his uncle shouted, \"Quite right, you do.  Now just get a move on,\nJosef, hurry up now!\"  \"I still have a few documents I need to prepare,\"\nsaid K., and, using the intercom, he summoned his deputy who entered a\nfew moments later.  K.'s uncle, still angry and excited, gestured with\nhis hand to show that K. had summoned him, even though there was no need\nwhatever to do so.  K. stood in front of the desk and explained to the\nyoung man, who listened calm and attentive, what would need to be done\nthat day in his absence, speaking in a calm voice and making use of\nvarious documents.   The presence of K.'s uncle while this was going on\nwas quite disturbing; he did not listen to what was being said,  but at\nfirst he stood there with eyes wide open and nervously biting his lips.\nThen he began to walk up and down the room, stopped now and then at the\nwindow, or stood in front of a picture always making various\nexclamations such as, \"That is totally incomprehensible to me!\" or \"Now\njust tell me, what are you supposed to make of that?!\"  The young man\npretended to notice nothing of this and listened to K.'s instructions\nthrough to the end, he made a few notes, bowed to both K. and his uncle\nand then left the room.  K.'s uncle had turned his back to him and was\nlooking out the window, bunching up the curtains with his outstretched\nhands.  The door had hardly closed when he called out, \"At last!  Now\nthat he's stopped jumping about we can go too!\"  Once they were in the\nfront hall of the bank, where several members of staff were standing\nabout and where, just then, the deputy director was walking across,\nthere was unfortunately no way of stopping K.'s uncle from continually\nasking questions about the trial.  \"Now then, Josef,\" he began, lightly\nacknowledging the bows from those around them as they passed, \"tell me\neverything about this trial; what sort of trial is it?\"  K. made a few\ncomments which conveyed little information, even laughed a little, and\nit  was only when they reached the front steps that he explained to his\nuncle that he had not wanted to talk openly in front of those people.\n\"Quite right,\" said his uncle, \"but now start talking.\"  With his head\nto one side, and smoking his cigar in short, impatient draughts, he\nlistened.  \"First of all, Uncle,\" said K., \"it's not a trial like you'd\nhave in a normal courtroom.\"  \"So much the worse,\" said his uncle.\n\"How's that?\" asked K., looking at him.  \"What I mean is, that's for the\nworse,\" he repeated.  They were standing on the front steps of the bank;\nas the doorkeeper seemed to be listening to what they were saying K.\ndrew his uncle down further, where they were absorbed into the bustle of\nthe street.  His uncle took K.'s arm and stopped asking questions with\nsuch urgency about the trial, they walked on for a while in silence.\n\"But how did all this come about?\" he eventually asked, stopping\nabruptly enough to startle the people walking behind, who had to avoid\nwalking into him.  \"Things like this don't come all of a sudden, they\nstart developing a long time beforehand, there must have been warning\nsigns of it, why didn't you write to me?  You know I'd do anything for\nyou, to some extent I am still your guardian, and until today that's\nsomething I was proud of.  I'll still help you, of course I will, only\nnow, now that the trial is already underway, it makes it very difficult.\nBut whatever; the best thing now is for you to take a short holiday\nstaying with us in the country.  You've lost weight, I can see that now.\nThe country life will give you strength, that will be good, there's\nbound to be a lot of hard work ahead of you.  But besides that it'll be\na way of getting you away from the court, to some extent.  Here they've\ngot every means of showing the powers at their disposal and they're\nautomatically bound to use them against you; in the country they'll\neither have to delegate authority to different bodies or just have to\ntry and bother you by letter, telegram or telephone.  And that's bound\nto weaken the effect, it won't release you from them but it'll give you\nroom to breathe.\"  \"You could forbid me to leave,\" said K., who had been\ndrawn slightly into his uncle's way of thinking by what he had been\nsaying.  \"I didn't think you would do it,\" said his uncle thoughtfully,\n\"you won't suffer too much loss of power by moving away.\"  K. grasped\nhis uncle under the arm to prevent him stopping still and said, \"I\nthought you'd think all this is less important than I do, and now you're\ntaking it so hard.\"  \"Josef,\" called his uncle trying to disentangle\nhimself from him so that he could stop walking, but K. did not let go,\n\"you've completely changed, you used to be so astute, are you losing it\nnow?  Do you want to lose the trial?  Do you realise what that would\nmean?  That would mean you would be simply destroyed.  And that everyone\nyou know would be pulled down with you or at the very least humiliated,\ndisgraced right down to the ground.  Josef, pull yourself together.  The\nway you're so indifferent about it, it's driving me mad.  Looking at you\nI can almost believe that old saying: 'Having a trial like that means\nlosing a trial like that'.\"  \"My dear Uncle,\" said K., \"it won't do any\ngood to get excited, it's no good for you to do it and it'd be no good\nfor me to do it.  The case won't be won by getting excited, and please\nadmit that my practical experience counts for something, just as I have\nalways and still do respect your experience, even when it surprises me.\nYou say that the family will also be affected by this trial; I really\ncan't see how, but that's beside the point and I'm quite willing to\nfollow your instructions in all of this.  Only, I don't see any\nadvantage in staying in the country, not even for you, as that would\nindicate flight and a sense of guilt.  And besides, although I am more\nsubject to persecution if I stay in the city I can also press the matter\nforward better here.\"  \"You're right,\" said his uncle in a tone that\nseemed to indicate they were finally coming closer to each other, \"I\njust made the suggestion because, as I saw it, if you stay in the city\nthe case will be put in danger by your indifference to it, and I thought\nit was better if I did the work for you.  But will you push things\nforward yourself with all your strength, if so, that will naturally be\nfar better.\"  \"We're agreed then,\" said K.  \"And do you have any\nsuggestions for what I should do next?\"  \"Well, naturally I'll have to\nthink about it,\" said his uncle, \"you must bear in mind that I've been\nliving in the country for twenty years now, almost without a break, you\nlose your ability to deal with matters like this.  But I do have some\nimportant connections with several people who, I expect, know their way\naround these things better than I do, and to contact them is a matter of\ncourse.  Out there in the country I've been getting out of condition,\nI'm sure you're already aware of that.  It's only at times like this\nthat you notice it yourself.  And this affair of yours came largely\nunexpected, although, oddly enough, I had expected something of the sort\nafter I'd read Erna's letter, and today when I saw your face I knew it\nwith almost total certainty.  But all that is by the by, the important\nthing now is, we have no time to lose.\"  Even while he was still\nspeaking, K.'s uncle had stood on tiptoe to summon a taxi and now he\npulled K. into the car behind himself as he called out an address to the\ndriver.  \"We're going now to see Dr. Huld, the lawyer,\" he said, \"we\nwere at school together.  I'm sure you know the name, don't you?  No?\nWell that is odd.  He's got a very good reputation as a defence\nbarrister and for working with the poor.  But I esteem him especially as\nsomeone you can trust.\"  \"It's alright with me, whatever you do,\" said\nK., although he was made uneasy by the rushed and urgent way his uncle\nwas dealing with the matter.  It was not very encouraging, as the\naccused, be to taken to a lawyer for poor people.  \"I didn't know,\" he\nsaid, \"that you could take on a lawyer in matters like this.\"  \"Well of\ncourse you can,\" said his uncle, \"that goes without saying.  Why\nwouldn't you take on a lawyer?  And now, so that I'm properly instructed\nin this matter, tell me what's been happening so far.\"  K. instantly\nbegan telling his uncle about what had been happening, holding nothing\nback - being completely open with him was the only way that K. could\nprotest at his uncle's belief that the trial was a great disgrace.  He\nmentioned Miss Buerstner's name just once and in passing, but that did\nnothing to diminish his openness about the trial as Miss Buerstner had no\nconnection with it.  As he spoke, he looked out the window and saw how,\njust then, they were getting closer to the suburb where the court\noffices were.  He drew this to his uncle's attention, but he did not\nfind the coincidence especially remarkable.  The taxi stopped in front\nof a dark building.  K.'s uncle knocked at the very first door at ground\nlevel; while they waited he smiled, showing his big teeth, and\nwhispered, \"Eight o'clock; not the usual sort of time to be visiting a\nlawyer, but Huld won't mind it from me.\"  Two large, black eyes appeared\nin the spy-hatch in the door, they stared at the two visitors for a\nwhile and then disappeared; the door, however, did not open.  K. and his\nuncle confirmed to each other the fact that they had seen the two eyes.\n\"A new maid, afraid of strangers,\" said K.'s uncle, and knocked again.\nThe eyes appeared once more.  This time they seemed almost sad, but the\nopen gas flame that burned with a hiss close above their heads gave off\nlittle light and that may have merely created an illusion.  \"Open the\ndoor,\" called K.'s uncle, raising his fist against it, \"we are friends\nof Dr. Huld, the lawyer!\"  \"Dr. Huld is ill,\" whispered someone behind\nthem.  In a doorway at the far end of a narrow passage stood a man in\nhis dressing gown, giving them this information in an extremely quiet\nvoice.  K.'s uncle, who had already been made very angry by the long\nwait, turned abruptly round and retorted, \"Ill?  You say he's ill?\" and\nstrode towards the gentleman in a way that seemed almost threatening, as\nif he were the illness himself.  \"They've opened the door for you, now,\"\nsaid the gentleman, pointing at the door of the lawyer.  He pulled his\ndressing gown together and disappeared.  The door had indeed been\nopened, a young girl - K. recognised the dark, slightly bulging eyes -\nstood in the hallway in a long white apron, holding a candle in her\nhand.  \"Next time, open up sooner!\" said K.'s uncle instead of a\ngreeting, while the girl made a slight curtsey. \"Come along, Josef,\" he\nthen said to K. who was slowly moving over towards the girl. \"Dr. Huld\nis unwell,\" said the girl as K.'s uncle, without stopping, rushed\ntowards one of the doors.  K. continued to look at the girl in amazement\nas she turned round to block the way into the living room, she had a\nround face like a puppy's, not only the pale cheeks and the chin were\nround but the temples and the hairline were too.  \"Josef!\" called his\nuncle once more, and he asked the girl, \"It's trouble with his heart, is\nit?\"  \"I think it is, sir,\" said the girl, who by now had found time to\ngo ahead with the candle and open the door into the room. In one corner\nof the room, where the light of the candle did not reach, a face with a\nlong beard looked up from the bed.  \"Leni, who's this coming in?\" asked\nthe lawyer, unable to recognise his guests because he was dazzled by the\ncandle.  \"It's your old friend, Albert,\" said K.'s uncle.  \"Oh, Albert,\"\nsaid the lawyer, falling back onto his pillow as if this visit meant he\nwould not need to keep up appearances.  \"Is it really as bad as that?\"\nasked K.'s uncle, sitting on the edge of the bed.  \"I don't believe it\nis.  It's a recurrence of your heart trouble and it'll pass over like\nthe other times.\"  \"Maybe,\" said the lawyer quietly, \"but it's just as\nmuch trouble as it's ever been.  I can hardly breathe, I can't sleep at\nall and I'm getting weaker by the day.\"  \"I see,\" said K.'s uncle,\npressing his panama hat firmly against his knee with his big hand.\n\"That is bad news.  But are you getting the right sort of care?  And\nit's so depressing in here, it's so dark.  It's a long time since I was\nlast here, but it seemed to me friendlier then.  Even your young lady\nhere doesn't seem to have much life in her, unless she's just\npretending.\"  The maid was still standing by the door with the candle;\nas far as could be made out, she was watching K. more than she was\nwatching his uncle even while the latter was still speaking about her.\nK. leant against a chair that he had pushed near to the girl.  \"When\nyou're as ill as I am,\" said the lawyer, \"you need to have peace.  I\ndon't find it depressing.\"  After a short pause he added, \"and Leni\nlooks after me well, she's a good girl.\"  But that was not enough to\npersuade K.'s uncle, he had visibly taken against his friend's carer\nand, even though he did not contradict the invalid, he persecuted her\nwith his scowl as she went over to the bed, put the candle on the\nbedside table and, leaning over the bed, made a fuss of him by tidying\nthe pillows.  K.'s uncle nearly forgot the need to show any\nconsideration for the man who lay ill in bed, he stood up, walked up and\ndown behind the carer, and K. would not have been surprised if he had\ngrabbed hold of her skirts behind her and dragged her away from the bed.\nK. himself looked on calmly, he was not even disappointed at finding the\nlawyer unwell, he had been able to do nothing to oppose the enthusiasm\nhis uncle had developed for the matter, he was glad that this enthusiasm\nhad now been distracted without his having to do anything about it.  His\nuncle, probably simply wishing to be offensive to the lawyer's\nattendant, then said, \"Young lady, now please leave us alone for a\nwhile, I have some personal matters to discuss with my friend.\"  Dr.\nHuld's carer was still leant far over the invalid's bed and smoothing\nout the cloth covering the wall next to it, she merely turned her head\nand then, in striking contrast with the anger that first stopped K.'s\nuncle from speaking and then let the words out in a gush, she said very\nquietly, \"You can see that Dr. Huld is so ill that he can't discuss any\nmatters at all.\"  It was probably just for the sake of convenience that\nshe had repeated the words spoken by K.'s uncle, but an onlooker might\neven have perceived it as mocking him and he, of course, jumped up as if\nhe had just been stabbed.  \"You damned ...,\" in the first gurglings of\nhis excitement his words could hardly be understood, K. was startled\neven though he had been expecting something of the sort and ran to his\nuncle with the intention, no doubt, of closing his mouth with both his\nhands.  Fortunately, though, behind the girl, the invalid raised himself\nup, K.'s uncle made an ugly face as if swallowing something disgusting\nand then, somewhat calmer, said, \"We have naturally not lost our senses,\nnot yet; if what I am asking for were not possible I would not be asking\nfor it.  Now please, go!\"  The carer stood up straight by the bed\ndirectly facing K.'s uncle, K. thought he noticed that with one hand she\nwas stroking the lawyer's hand.  \"You can say anything in front of\nLeni,\" said the invalid, in a tone that was unmistakably imploring.\n\"It's not my business,\" said K.'s uncle, \"and it's not my secrets.\"  And\nhe twisted himself round as if wanting to go into no more negotiations\nbut giving himself a little more time to think. \"Whose business is it\nthen?\" asked the lawyer in an exhausted voice as he leant back again.\n\"My nephew's,\" said K.'s uncle, \"and I've brought him along with me.\"\nAnd he introduced him, \"Chief Clerk Josef K.\"  \"Oh!\" said the invalid,\nnow with much more life in him, and reached out his hand towards K.  \"Do\nforgive me, I didn't notice you there at all.\"  Then he then said to his\ncarer, \"Leni, go,\" stretching his hand out to her as if this were a\nfarewell that would have to last for a long time.  This time the girl\noffered no resistance.  \"So you,\" he finally said to K.'s uncle, who had\nalso calmed down and stepped closer, \"you haven't come to visit me\nbecause I'm ill but you've come on business.\"  The lawyer now looked so\nmuch stronger that it seemed the idea of being visited because he was\nill had somehow made him weak, he remained supporting himself of one\nelbow, which must have been rather tiring, and continually pulled at a\nlock of hair in the middle of his beard.  \"You already look much\nbetter,\" said K.'s uncle, \"now that that witch has gone outside.\" He\ninterrupted himself, whispered, \"I bet you she's listening!\" and sprang\nover to the door.  But behind the door there was no-one, K.'s uncle came\nback not disappointed, as her not listening seemed to him worse than if\nshe had been, but probably somewhat embittered.  \"You're mistaken about\nher,\" said the lawyer, but did nothing more to defend her; perhaps that\nwas his way of indicating that she did not need defending.  But in a\ntone that was much more committed he went on, \"As far as your nephew's\naffairs are concerned, this will be an extremely difficult undertaking\nand I'd count myself lucky if my strength lasted out long enough for it;\nI'm greatly afraid it won't do, but anyway I don't want to leave\nanything untried; if I don't last out you can always get somebody else.\nTo be honest, this matter interests me too much, and I can't bring\nmyself to give up the chance of taking some part in it.  If my heart\ndoes totally give out then at least it will have found a worthy affair\nto fail in.\"  K. believed he understood not a word of this entire\nspeech, he looked at his uncle for an explanation but his uncle sat on\nthe bedside table with the candle in his hand, a medicine bottle had\nrolled off the table onto the floor, he nodded to everything the lawyer\nsaid, agreed to everything, and now and then looked at K. urging him to\nshow the same compliance.  Maybe K.'s uncle had already told the lawyer\nabout the trial.  But that was impossible, everything that had happened\nso far spoke against it.  So he said,\n\"I don't understand ...\"  \"Well, maybe I've misunderstood what you've\nbeen saying,\" said the lawyer, just as astonished and embarrassed as K.\n\"Perhaps I've been going too fast.  What was it you wanted to speak to\nme about?  I thought it was to do with your trial.\"  \"Of course it is,\"\nsaid K.'s uncle, who then asked K., \"So what is it you want?\"  \"Yes, but\nhow is it that you know anything about me and my case?\" asked K.  \"Oh, I\nsee,\" said the lawyer with a smile.  \"I am a lawyer, I move in court\ncircles, people talk about various different cases and the more\ninteresting ones stay in your mind, especially when they concern the\nnephew of a friend.  There's nothing very remarkable about that.\"  \"What\nis it you want, then?\" asked K.'s uncle once more, \"You seem so uneasy\nabout it\"  \"You move in this court's circles?\" asked K.  \"Yes,\" said the\nlawyer.  \"You're asking questions like a child,\" said K.'s uncle.  \"What\ncircles should I move in, then, if not with members of my own\ndiscipline?\" the lawyer added.  It sounded so indisputable that K. gave\nno answer at all.  \"But you work in the High Court, not that court in\nthe attic,\" he had wanted to say but could not bring himself to actually\nutter it.  \"You have to realise,\" the lawyer continued, in a tone as if\nhe were explaining something obvious, unnecessary and incidental,  \"you\nhave to realise that I also derive great advantage for my clients from\nmixing with those people, and do so in many different ways, it's not\nsomething you can keep talking about all the time.  I'm at a bit of a\ndisadvantage now, of course, because of my illness, but I still get\nvisits from some good friends of mine at the court and I learn one or\ntwo things.  It might even be that I learn more than many of those who\nare in the best of health and spend all day in court.  And I'm receiving\na very welcome visit right now, for instance.\"  And he pointed into a\ndark corner of the room.  \"Where?\" asked K., almost uncouth in his\nsurprise.  He looked round uneasily; the little candle gave off far too\nlittle light to reach as far as the wall opposite.  And then, something\ndid indeed begin to move there in the corner.  In the light of the\ncandle held up by K.'s uncle an elderly gentleman could be seen sitting\nbeside a small table.  He had been sitting there for so long without\nbeing noticed that he could hardly have been breathing.  Now he stood up\nwith a great deal of fuss, clearly unhappy that attention had been drawn\nto him.  It was as if, by flapping his hands about like short wings, he\nhoped to deflect any introductions and greetings, as if he wanted on no\naccount to disturb the others by his presence and seemed to be exhorting\nthem to leave him back in the dark and forget about his being there.\nThat, however, was something that could no longer be granted him.  \"You\ntook us by surprise, you see,\" said the lawyer in explanation,\ncheerfully indicating to the gentleman that he should come closer,\nwhich, slowly, hesitatingly, looking all around him, but with a certain\ndignity, he did.  \"The office director - oh, yes, forgive me, I haven't\nintroduced you - this is my friend Albert K., this is his nephew, the\nchief clerk Josef K., and this is the office director - so, the office\ndirector was kind enough to pay me a visit.  It's only possible to\nappreciate just how valuable a visit like this is if you've been let\ninto the secret of what a pile of work the office director has heaped\nover him.  Well, he came anyway, we were having a peaceful chat, as far\nas I was able when I'm so weak, and although we hadn't told Leni she\nmustn't let anyone in as we weren't expecting anyone, we still would\nrather have remained alone, but then along came you, Albert, thumping\nyour fists on the door, the office director moved over into the corner\npulling his table and chair with him, but now it turns out we might\nhave, that is, if that's what you wish, we might have something to\ndiscuss with each other and it would be good if we can all come back\ntogether again.  - Office director  ...,\" he said with his head on one\nside, pointing with a humble smile to an armchair near the bed.  \"I'm\nafraid I'll only be able to stay a few minutes more,\" smiled the office\ndirector as he spread himself out in the armchair and looked at the\nclock.  \"Business calls.  But I wouldn't want to miss the chance of\nmeeting a friend of my friend.\"  He inclined his head slightly toward\nK.'s uncle, who seemed very happy with his new acquaintance, but he was\nnot the sort of person to express his feelings of deference and\nresponded to the office director's words with embarrassed, but loud,\nlaughter.  A horrible sight!  K. was able to quietly watch everything as\nnobody paid any attention to him, the office director took over as\nleader of the conversation as seemed to be his habit once he had been\ncalled forward, the lawyer listened attentively with his hand to his\near, his initial weakness having perhaps only had the function of\ndriving away his new visitors, K.'s uncle served as candle-bearer -\nbalancing the candle on his thigh while the office director frequently\nglanced nervously at it - and was soon free of his embarrassment and was\nquickly enchanted not only by the office director's speaking manner but\nalso by the gentle, waving hand-movements with which he accompanied it.\nK., leaning against the bedpost, was totally ignored by the office\ndirector, perhaps deliberately, and served the old man only as audience.\nAnd besides, he had hardly any idea what the conversation was about and\nhis thoughts soon turned to the care assistant and the ill treatment she\nhad suffered from his uncle.  Soon after, he began to wonder whether he\nhad not seen the office director somewhere before, perhaps among the\npeople who were at his first hearing.  He may have been mistaken, but\nthought the office director might well have been among the old gentlemen\nwith the thin beards in the first row.\n\n        There was then a noise that everyone heard from the hallway as if\nsomething of porcelain were being broken.  \"I'll go and see what's\nhappened,\" said K., who slowly left the room as if giving the others the\nchance to stop him.  He had hardly stepped into the hallway, finding his\nbearings in the darkness with his hand still firmly holding the door,\nwhen another small hand, much smaller than K.'s own, placed itself on\nhis and gently shut the door.  It was the carer who had been waiting\nthere.  \"Nothing has happened,\" she whispered to him, \"I just threw a\nplate against the wall to get you out of there.\"   \"I was thinking about\nyou, as well,\" replied K. uneasily.  \"So much the better,\" said the\ncarer.  \"Come with me\".  A few steps along, they came to a frosted glass\ndoor which the carer opened for him.  \"Come in here,\" she said.  It was\nclearly the lawyer's office, fitted out with old, heavy furniture, as\nfar as could be seen in the moonlight which now illuminated just a\nsmall, rectangular section of the floor by each of the three big\nwindows.  \"This way,\" said the carer, pointing to a dark trunk with a\ncarved, wooden backrest.  When he had sat down, K. continued to look\nround the room, it was a large room with a high ceiling, the clients of\nthis lawyer for the poor must have felt quite lost in it.  K. thought he\ncould see the little steps with which visitors would approach the\nmassive desk.  But then he forgot about all of this and had eyes only\nfor the carer who sat very close beside him, almost pressing him against\nthe armrest.  \"I did think,\" she said \"you would come out here to me by\nyourself without me having to call you first.  It was odd.  First you stare\nat me as soon as you come in, and then you keep me waiting.  And you\nought to call me Leni, too,\" she added quickly and suddenly, as if no\nmoment of this conversation should be lost.  \"Gladly,\" said K.  \"But as\nfor its being odd, Leni, that's easy to explain.  Firstly, I had to\nlisten to what the old men were saying and couldn't leave without a good\nreason, but secondly I'm not a bold  person, if anything I'm quite shy,\nand you, Leni, you didn't really look like you could be won over in one\nstroke, either.\"  \"That's not it,\" said Leni, laying one arm on the\narmrest and looking at K., \"you didn't like me, and I don't suppose you\nlike me now, either.\"  \"Liking wouldn't be very much,\" said K.,\nevasively.  \"Oh!\" she exclaimed with a smile, thus making use of  K.'s\ncomment to gain an advantage over him.  So K. remained silent for a\nwhile.  By now, he had become used to the darkness in the room and was\nable to make out various fixtures and fittings.  He was especially\nimpressed by a large picture hanging to the right of the door, he leant\nforward in order to see it better.  It depicted a man wearing a judge's\nrobes; he was sitting on a lofty throne gilded in a way that shone forth\nfrom the picture.  The odd thing about the picture was that this judge\nwas not sitting there in dignified calm but had his left arm pressed\nagainst the back and armrest, his right arm, however, was completely\nfree and only grasped the armrest with his hand, as if about to jump up\nany moment in vigorous outrage and make some decisive comment or even to\npass sentence.  The accused was probably meant to be imagined at the\nfoot of the steps, the top one of which could be seen in the picture,\ncovered with a yellow carpet.  \"That might be my judge,\" said K.,\npointing to the picture with one finger.  \"I know him,\" said Leni\nlooking up at the picture, \"he comes here quite often.  That picture is\nfrom when he was young, but he can never have looked anything like it,\nas he's tiny, minute almost.  But despite that, he had himself made to\nlook bigger in the picture as he's madly vain, just like everyone round\nhere.  But even I'm vain and that makes me very unhappy that you don't\nlike me.\"  K. replied to that last comment merely by embracing Leni and\ndrawing her towards him, she lay her head quietly on his shoulder.  To\nthe rest of it, though, he said, \"What rank is he?\"  \"He's an examining\njudge,\" she said, taking hold of the hand with which K. held her and\nplaying with his fingers.  \"Just an examining judge once again,\" said K.\nin disappointment, \"the senior officials keep themselves hidden.  But\nhere he is sitting on a throne.\"  \"That's all just made up,\" said Leni\nwith her face bent over K.'s hand, \"really he's sitting on a kitchen\nchair with an old horse blanket folded over it.  But do you have to be\nalways thinking about your trial?\" she added slowly.  \"No, not at all,\"\nsaid K., \"I probably even think too little about it.\"  \"That's not the\nmistake you're making,\" said Leni, \"you're too unyielding, that's what\nI've heard.\"  \"Who said that?\" asked K., he felt her body against his\nchest and looked down on her rich, dark, tightly-bound hair.  \"I'd be\nsaying too much if I told you that,\" answered Leni.  \"Please don't ask\nfor names, but do stop making these mistakes of yours, stop being so\nunyielding, there's nothing you can do to defend yourself from this\ncourt, you have to confess.  So confess to them as soon as you get the\nchance.  It's only then that they give you the chance to get away, not\ntill then.  Only, without help from outside even that's impossible, but\nyou needn't worry about getting this help as I want to help you myself.\"\n\"You understand a lot about this court and what sort of tricks are\nneeded,\" said K. as he lifted her, since she was pressing in much too\nclose to him, onto his lap.  \"That's alright, then,\" she said, and made\nherself comfortable on his lap by smoothing out her skirt and adjusting\nher blouse.  Then she hung both her arms around his neck, leant back and\ntook a long look at him.  \"And what if I don't confess, could you not\nhelp me then?\" asked K. to test her out.  I'm accumulating women to help\nme, he thought to himself almost in amazement, first Miss Buerstner, then\nthe court usher's wife, and now this little care assistant who seems to\nhave some incomprehensible need for me.  The way she sits on my lap as\nif it were her proper place!  \"No,\" answered Leni, slowly shaking her\nhead, \"I couldn't help you then.  But you don't want my help anyway, it\nmeans nothing to you, you're too stubborn and won't be persuaded.\"\nThen, after a while she asked, \"Do you have a lover?\"  \"No,\" said K.\n\"Oh, you must have,\" she said.  \"Well, I have really,\" said K.  \"Just\nthink, I've even betrayed her while I'm carrying her photograph with\nme.\"  Leni insisted he show her a photograph of Elsa, and then, hunched\non his lap, studied the picture closely.  The photograph was not one\nthat had been taken while Elsa was posing for it, it showed her just\nafter she had been in a wild dance such as she liked to do in wine bars,\nher skirt was still flung out as she span round, she had placed her\nhands on her firm hips and, with her neck held taut, looked to one side\nwith a laugh; you could not see from the picture whom her laugh was\nintended for.  \"She's very tightly laced,\" said Leni, pointing to the\nplace where she thought this could be seen.  \"I don't like her, she's\nclumsy and crude.  But maybe she's gentle and friendly towards you,\nthat's the impression you get from the picture.  Big, strong girls like\nthat often don't know how to be anything but gentle and friendly.  Would\nshe be capable of sacrificing herself for you, though?\"  \"No,\" said K.,\n\"she isn't gentle or friendly, and nor would she be capable of\nsacrificing herself for me.  But I've never yet asked any of those\nthings of her.  I've never looked at this picture as closely as you.\"\n\"You can't think much of her, then,\" said Leni. \"She can't be your lover\nafter all.\"  \"Yes she is,\" said K., \"I'm not going to take my word back\non that.\"  \"Well she might be your lover now, then,\" said Leni, \"but you\nwouldn't miss her much if you lost her or if you exchanged her for\nsomebody else, me for instance.\"  \"That is certainly conceivable,\" said\nK. with a smile, \"but she does have one major advantage over you, she\nknows nothing about my trial, and even if she did she wouldn't think\nabout it.  She wouldn't try to persuade me to be less unyielding.\"  \"Well\nthat's no advantage,\" said Leni.  \"If she's got no advantage other than\nthat, I can keep on hoping.  Has she got any bodily defects?\"  \"'Bodily\ndefects'?\" asked K.  \"Yeah,\" said Leni, \"as I do have a bodily defect,\njust a little one.  Look.\"  She spread the middle and ring fingers of\nher right hand apart from each other.  Between those fingers the flap of\nskin connecting them reached up almost as far as the top joint of the\nlittle finger.  In the darkness, K. did not see at first what it was she\nwanted to show him, so she led his hand to it so that he could feel.\n\"What a freak of nature,\" said K., and when he had taken a look at the\nwhole hand he added, \"What a pretty claw!\"  Leni looked on with a kind\nof pride as K. repeatedly opened and closed her two fingers in\namazement, until, finally, he briefly kissed them and let go.  \"Oh!\" she\nimmediately exclaimed, \"you kissed me!\"  Hurriedly, and with her mouth\nopen, she clambered up K.'s lap with her knees.  He was almost aghast as\nhe looked up at her, now that she was so close to him there was a\nbitter, irritating smell from her, like pepper, she grasped his head,\nleant out over him, and bit and kissed his neck, even biting into his\nhair.  \"I've taken her place!\" she exclaimed from time to time.  \"Just\nlook, now you've taken me instead of her!\"   Just then, her knee slipped\nout and, with a little cry, she nearly fell down onto the carpet, K.\ntried to hold her by putting his arms around her and was pulled down\nwith her.  \"Now you're mine,\" she said.  Her last words to him as he\nleft were, \"Here's the key to the door, come whenever you want\", and she\nplanted an undirected kiss on his back.  When he stepped out the front\ndoor there was a light rain falling, he was about to go to the middle of\nthe street to see if he could still glimpse Leni at the window when K.'s\nuncle leapt out of a car that K., thinking of other things, had not seen\nwaiting outside the building.  He took hold of K. by both arms and\nshoved him against the door as if he wanted to nail him to it.  \"Young\nman,\" he shouted, \"how could you do a thing like that?!  Things were\ngoing well with this business of yours, now you've caused it terrible\ndamage.  You slip off with some dirty, little thing who, moreover, is\nobviously the lawyer's beloved, and stay away for hours.  You don't even\ntry to find an excuse, don't try to hide anything, no, you're quite open\nabout it, you run off with her and stay there.  And meanwhile we're\nsitting there, your uncle who's going to such effort for you, the lawyer\nwho needs to be won over to your side, and above all the office\ndirector, a very important gentleman who is in direct command of your\naffair in its present stage.  We wanted to discuss how best to help you,\nI had to handle the lawyer very carefully, he had to handle the office\ndirector carefully, and you had most reason of all to at least give me\nsome support.  Instead of which you stay away.  Eventually we couldn't\nkeep up the pretence any longer, but these are polite and highly capable\nmen, they didn't say anything about it so as to spare my feelings but in\nthe end not even they could continue to force themselves and, as they\ncouldn't speak about the matter in hand, they became silent.  We sat\nthere for several minutes, listening to see whether you wouldn't finally\ncome back.  All in vain.  In the end the office director stood up, as he\nhad stayed far longer than he had originally intended, made his\nfarewell, looked at me in sympathy without being able to help, he waited\nat the door for a long time although it's more than I can understand why\nhe was being so good, and then he went.  I, of course, was glad he'd\ngone, I'd been holding my breath all this time.  All this had even more\naffect on the lawyer lying there ill, when I took my leave of him, the\ngood man, he was quite unable to speak.  You have probably contributed\nto his total collapse and so brought the very man who you are dependent\non closer to his death.  And me, your own uncle, you leave me here in\nthe rain - just feel this, I'm wet right through - waiting here for\nhours, sick with worry.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter Seven\nLawyer - Manufacturer - Painter\n\n        One winter morning - snow was falling in the dull light outside -\nK. was sitting in his office, already extremely tired despite the early\nhour.  He had told the servitor he was engaged in a major piece of work\nand none of the junior staff should be allowed in to see him, so he\nwould not be disturbed by them at least.  But instead of working he\nturned round in his chair, slowly moved various items around his desk,\nbut then, without being aware of it, he lay his arm stretched out on the\ndesk top and sat there immobile with his head sunk down on his chest.\n\n        He was no longer able to get the thought of the trial out of his\nhead.  He had often wondered whether it might not be a good idea to work\nout a written defence and hand it in to the court.  It would contain a\nshort description of his life and explain why he had acted the way he\nhad at each event that was in any way important, whether he now\nconsidered he had acted well or ill, and his reasons for each.  There\nwas no doubt of the advantages a written defence of this sort would have\nover relying on the lawyer, who was anyway not without his shortcomings.\nK. had no idea what actions the lawyer was taking; it was certainly not\na lot, it was more than a month since the lawyer had summoned him, and\nnone of the previous discussions had given K. the impression that this\nman would be able to do much for him.  Most importantly, he had asked\nhim hardly any questions.  And there were so many questions here to be\nasked.  Asking questions were the most important thing.  K. had the\nfeeling that he would be able to ask all the questions needed here\nhimself.  The lawyer, in contrast, did not ask questions but did all the\ntalking himself or sat silently facing him, leant forward slightly over\nthe desk, probably because he was hard of hearing, pulled on a strand of\nhair in the middle of his beard and looked down at the carpet, perhaps\nat the very spot where K. had lain with Leni.  Now and then he would\ngive K. some vague warning of the sort you give to children.  His\nspeeches were as pointless as they were boring, and K. decided that when\nthe final bill came he would pay not a penny for them.  Once the lawyer\nthought he had humiliated K. sufficiently, he usually started something\nthat would raise his spirits again.  He had already, he would then say,\nwon many such cases, partly or in whole, cases which may not really have\nbeen as difficult as this one but which, on the face of it, had even\nless hope of success.  He had a list of these cases here in the drawer -\nhere he would tap on one or other of the drawers in his desk - but\ncould, unfortunately, not show them to K. as they dealt with official\nsecrets.  Nonetheless, the great experience he had acquired through all\nthese cases would, of course, be of benefit to K.  He had, of course,\nbegun work straight away and was nearly ready to submit the first\ndocuments.  They would be very important because the first impression\nmade by the defence will often determine the whole course of the\nproceedings.  Unfortunately, though, he would still have to make it\nclear to K. that the first documents submitted are sometimes not even\nread by the court.  They simply put them with the other documents and\npoint out that, for the time being, questioning and observing the\naccused are much more important than anything written.  If the applicant\nbecomes insistent, then they add that before they come to any decision,\nas soon as all the material has been brought together, with due regard,\nof course, to all the documents, then these first documents to have been\nsubmitted will also be checked over.  But unfortunately, even this is\nnot usually true, the first documents submitted are usually mislaid or\nlost completely, and even if they do keep them right to the end they are\nhardly read, although the lawyer only knew about this from rumour.  This\nis all very regrettable, but not entirely without its justifications.\nBut K. should not forget that the trial would not be public, if the\ncourt deems it necessary it can be made public but there is no law that\nsays it has to be.  As a result, the accused and his defence don't have\naccess even to the court records, and especially not to the indictment,\nand that means we generally don't know - or at least not precisely -\nwhat the first documents need to be about, which means that if they do\ncontain anything of relevance to the case it's only by a lucky\ncoincidence.  If anything about the individual charges and the reasons\nfor them comes out clearly or can be guessed at while the accused is\nbeing questioned, then it's possible to work out and submit documents\nthat really direct the issue and present proof, but not before.\nConditions like this, of course, place the defence in a very\nunfavourable and difficult position.  But that is what they intend.  In\nfact, defence is not really allowed under the law, it's only tolerated,\nand there is even some dispute about whether the relevant parts of the\nlaw imply even that.  So strictly speaking, there is no such thing as a\ncounsel acknowledged by the court, and anyone who comes before this\ncourt as counsel is basically no more than a barrack room lawyer.  The\neffect of all this, of course, is to remove the dignity of the whole\nprocedure, the next time K. is in the court offices he might like to\nhave a look in at the lawyers' room, just so that he's seen it.  He\nmight well be quite shocked by the people he sees assembled there.  The\nroom they've been allocated, with its narrow space and low ceiling, will\nbe enough to show what contempt the court has for these people.  The\nonly light in the room comes through a little window that is so high up\nthat, if you want to look out of it, you first have to get one of your\ncolleagues to support you on his back, and even then the smoke from the\nchimney just in front of it will go up your nose and make your face\nblack.  In the floor of this room - to give yet another example of the\nconditions there - there is a hole that's been there for more than a\nyear, it's not so big that a man could fall through, but it is big\nenough for your foot to disappear through it.  The lawyers' room is on\nthe second floor of the attic; if your foot does go through it will hang\ndown into the first floor of the attic underneath it, and right in the\ncorridor where the litigants are waiting.  It's no exaggeration when\nlawyers say that conditions like that are a disgrace.  Complaints to the\nmanagement don't have the slightest effect, but the lawyers are strictly\nforbidden to alter anything in the room at their own expense.  But even\ntreating the lawyers in this way has its reasons.  They want, as far as\npossible, to prevent any kind of defence, everything should be made the\nresponsibility of the accused.  Not a bad point of view, basically, but\nnothing could be more mistaken than to think from that that lawyers are\nnot necessary for the accused in this court.  On the contrary, there is\nno court where they are less needed than here.  This is because\nproceedings are generally kept secret not only from the public but also\nfrom the accused.  Only as far as that is possible, of course, but it is\npossible to a very large extent.  And the accused doesn't get to see the\ncourt records either, and it's very difficult to infer what's in the\ncourt records from what's been said during questioning based on them,\nespecially for the accused who is in a difficult situation and is faced\nwith every possible worry to distract him.  This is when the defence\nbegins.  Counsel for the defence are not normally allowed to be present\nwhile the accused is being questioned, so afterwards, and if possible\nstill at the door of the interview room, he has to learn what he can\nabout it from him and extract whatever he can that might be of use, even\nthough what the accused has to report is often very confused.  But that\nis not the most important thing, as there's really not a lot that can be\nlearned in this way, although in this, as with anything else, a\ncompetent man will learn more than another.  Nonetheless, the most\nimportant thing is the lawyer's personal connections, that's where the\nreal value of taking counsel lies.  Now K. will most likely have already\nlearned from his own experience that, among its very lowest orders, the\ncourt organisation does have its imperfections, the court is strictly\nclosed to the public, but staff who forget their duty or who take bribes\ndo, to some extent, show where the gaps are. This is where most lawyers\nwill push their way in, this is where bribes are paid and information\nextracted, there have even, in earlier times at least, been incidents\nwhere documents have been stolen.  There's no denying that some\nsurprisingly favourable results have been attained for the accused in\nthis way, for a limited time, and these petty advocates then strut to\nand fro on the basis of them and attract new clients, but for the\nfurther course of the proceedings it signifies either nothing or nothing\ngood.  The only things of real value are honest personal contacts,\ncontacts with higher officials, albeit higher officials of the lower\ngrades, you understand.  That is the only way the progress of the trial\ncan be influenced, hardly noticeable at first, it's true, but from then\non it becomes more and more visible.  There are, of course, not many\nlawyers who can do this, and K. has made a very good choice in this\nmatter.  There were probably no more than one or two who had as many\ncontacts as Dr. Huld, but they don't bother with the company of the\nlawyers' room and have nothing to do with it.  This means they have all\nthe less contact with the court officials.  It is not at all necessary\nfor Dr. Huld to go to the court, wait in the ante-rooms for the\nexamining judges to turn up, if they turn up, and try to achieve\nsomething which, according to the judges' mood is usually more apparent\nthan real and most often not even that.  No, K. has seen for himself\nthat the court officials, including some who are quite high up, come\nforward without being asked, are glad to give information which is fully\nopen or at least easy to understand, they discuss the next stages in the\nproceedings, in fact in some cases they can be won over and are quite\nwilling to adopt the other person's point of view.  However, when this\nhappens, you should never trust them too far, as however firmly they may\nhave declared this new point of view in favour of the defendant they\nmight well go straight back to their offices and write a report for the\ncourt that says just the opposite, and might well be even harder on the\ndefendant than the original view, the one they insist they've been fully\ndissuaded from.  And, of course, there's no way of defending yourself\nfrom this, something said in private is indeed in private and cannot\nthen be used in public, it's not something that makes it easy for the\ndefence to keep those gentlemen's favour.  On the other hand, it's also\ntrue that the gentlemen don't become involved with the defence - which\nwill of course be done with great expertise - just for philanthropic\nreasons or in order to be friendly, in some respects it would be truer\nto say that they, too, have it allocated to them.  This is where the\ndisadvantages of a court structure that, right from the start,\nstipulates that all proceedings take place in private, come into force.\nIn normal, mediocre trials its officials have contact with the public,\nand they're very well equipped for it, but here they don't; normal\ntrials run their course all by themselves, almost, and just need a nudge\nhere and there; but when they're faced with cases that are especially\ndifficult they're as lost as they often are with ones that are very\nsimple; they're forced to spend all their time, day and night, with\ntheir laws, and so they don't have the right feel for human\nrelationships, and that's a serious shortcoming in cases like this.\nThat's when they come for advice to the lawyer, with a servant behind\nthem carrying the documents which normally are kept so secret.  You\ncould have seen many gentlemen at this window, gentlemen of whom you\nwould least expect it, staring out this window in despair on the street\nbelow while the lawyer is at his desk studying the documents so that he\ncan give them good advice.  And at times like that it's also possible to\nsee how exceptionally seriously these gentlemen take their professions\nand how they are thrown into great confusion by difficulties which it's\njust not in their natures to overcome.  But they're not in an easy\nposition, to regard their positions as easy would be to do them an\ninjustice.  The different ranks and hierarchies of the court are\nendless, and even someone who knows his way around them cannot always\ntell what's going to happen.  But even for the junior officials, the\nproceedings in the courtrooms are usually kept secret, so they are\nhardly able to see how the cases they work with proceed, court affairs\nappear in their range of vision often without their knowing where they\ncome from and they move on further without their learning where they go.\nSo civil servants like this are not able to learn the things you can\nlearn from studying the successive stages that individual trials go\nthrough, the final verdict or the reasons for it.  They're only allowed\nto deal with that part of the trial which the law allocates them, and\nthey usually know less about the results of their work after it's left\nthem than the defence does, even though the defence will usually stay in\ncontact with the accused until the trial is nearly at its end, so that\nthe court officials can learn many useful things from the defence.\nBearing all this in mind, does it still surprise K. that the officials\nare irritated and often express themselves about the litigants in\nunflattering ways - which is an experience shared by everyone.  All the\nofficials are irritated, even when they appear calm.  This causes many\ndifficulties for the junior advocates, of course.  There is a story, for\ninstance, that has very much the ring of truth about it.  It goes like\nthis: One of the older officials, a good and peaceful man, was dealing\nwith a difficult matter for the court which had become very confused,\nespecially thanks to the contributions from the lawyers.  He had been\nstudying it for a day and a night without a break - as these officials\nare indeed hard working, no-one works as hard as they do.  When it was\nnearly morning, and he had been working for twenty-four hours with\nprobably very little result, he went to the front entrance, waited there\nin ambush, and every time a lawyer tried to enter the building he would\nthrow him down the steps.  The lawyers gathered together down in front\nof the steps and discussed with each other what they should do; on the\none hand they had actually no right to be allowed into the building so\nthat there was hardly anything that they could legally do to the\nofficial and, as I've already mentioned, they would have to be careful\nnot to set all the officials against them.  On the other hand, any day\nnot spent in court is a day lost for them and it was a matter of some\nimportance to force their way inside.  In the end, they agreed that they\nwould try to tire the old man out.  One lawyer after another was sent\nout to run up the steps and let himself be thrown down again, offering\nwhat resistance he could as long as it was passive resistance, and his\ncolleagues would catch him at the bottom of the steps.  That went on for\nabout an hour until the old gentleman, who was already exhausted from\nworking all night, was very tired and went back to his office.  Those\nwho were at the bottom of the steps could not believe it at first, so\nthey sent somebody out to go and look behind the door to see if there\nreally was no-one there, and only then did they all gather together and\nprobably didn't even dare to complain, as it's far from being the\nlawyers' job to introduce any improvements in the court system, or even\nto want to.  Even the most junior lawyer can understand the relationship\nthere to some extent, but one significant point is that almost every\ndefendant, even very simple people, begins to think of suggestions for\nimproving the court as soon as his proceedings have begun, many of them\noften even spend time and energy on the matter that could be spent far\nbetter elsewhere.  The only right thing to do is to learn how to deal\nwith the situation as it is.  Even if it were possible to improve any\ndetail of it - which is anyway no more than superstitious nonsense - the\nbest that they could achieve, although doing themselves incalculable\nharm in the process, is that they will have attracted the special\nattention of the officials for any case that comes up in the future, and\nthe officials are always ready to seek revenge.  Never attract attention\nto yourself!  Stay calm, however much it goes against your character!\nTry to gain some insight into the size of the court organism and how, to\nsome extent, it remains in a state of suspension, and that even if you\nalter something in one place you'll draw the ground out from under your\nfeet and might fall, whereas if an enormous organism like the court is\ndisrupted in any one place it finds it easy to provide a substitute for\nitself somewhere else.  Everything is connected with everything else and\nwill continue without any change or else, which is quite probable, even\nmore closed, more attentive, more strict, more malevolent.  So it's best\nto leave the work to the lawyers and not to keep disturbing them.  It\ndoesn't do much good to make accusations, especially if you can't make\nit clear what they're based on and their full significance, but it must\nbe said that K. caused a great deal of harm to his own case by his\nbehaviour towards the office director, he was a very influential man but\nnow he might as well be struck off the list of those who might do\nanything for K.  If the trial is mentioned, even just in passing,  it's\nquite obvious that he's ignoring it.  These officials are in many ways\njust like children.  Often, something quite harmless - although K.'s\nbehaviour could unfortunately not be called harmless - will leave them\nfeeling so offended that they will even stop talking with good friends\nof theirs, they turn away when they see them and do everything they can\nto oppose them.  But then, with no particular reason, surprisingly\nenough, some little joke that was only ever attempted because everything\nseemed so hopeless will make them laugh and they'll be reconciled.\nIt's both difficult and hard at the same time to deal with them, and\nthere's hardly any reason for it.  It's sometimes quite astonishing that\na single, average life is enough to encompass so much that it's at all\npossible ever to have any success in one's work here.  On the other\nhand, there are also dark moments, such as everyone has, when you think\nyou've achieved nothing at all, when it seems that the only trials to\ncome to a good end are those that were determined to have a good end\nfrom the start and would do so without any help, while all the others\nare lost despite all the running to and fro, all the effort, all the\nlittle, apparent successes that gave such joy.  Then you no longer feel\nvery sure of anything and, if asked about a trial that was doing well by\nits own nature but which was turned for the worse because you assisted\nin it, would not even dare deny that.  And even that is a kind of self-\nconfidence, but then it's the only one that's left.   Lawyers are\nespecially vulnerable to fits of depression of that sort - and they are\nno more than fits of depression of course - when a case is suddenly\ntaken out of their hands after they've been conducting it satisfactorily\nfor some time.  That's probably the worst that can happen to a lawyer.\nIt's not that the accused takes the case away from him, that hardly ever\nhappens, once a defendant has taken on a certain lawyer he has to stay\nwith him whatever happens.  How could he ever carry on by himself after\nhe's taken on help from a lawyer?  No, that just doesn't happen, but\nwhat does sometimes happen is that the trial takes on a course where the\nlawyer may not go along with it.  Client and trial are both simply taken\naway from the lawyer; and then even contact with the court officials\nwon't help, however good they are, as they don't know anything\nthemselves.  The trial will have entered a stage where no more help can\nbe given, where it's being processed in courts to which no-one has any\naccess, where the defendant cannot even be contacted by his lawyer.  You\ncome home one day and find all the documents you've submitted, which\nyou've worked hard to create and which you had the best hopes for, lying\non the desk, they've been sent back as they can't be carried through to\nthe next stage in the trial, they're just worthless scraps of paper.  It\ndoesn't mean that the case has been lost, not at all, or at least there\nis no decisive reason for supposing so, it's just that you don't know\nanything more about the case and won't be told anything of what's\nhappening.  Well, cases like that are the exceptions, I'm glad to say,\nand even if K.'s trial is one of them, it's still, for the time being, a\nlong way off.  But there was still plenty of opportunity for lawyers to\nget to work, and K. could be sure they would be made use of.  As he had\nsaid, the time for submitting documents was still in the future and\nthere was no rush to prepare them, it was much more important to start\nthe initial discussions with the appropriate officials, and they had\nalready taken place.  With varying degrees of success, it must be said.\nIt was much better not to give away any details before their time, as in\nthat way K. could only be influenced unfavourably and his hopes might be\nraised or he might be made too anxious, better just to say that some\nindividuals have spoken very favourably and shown themselves very\nwilling to help, although others have spoken less favourably, but even\nthey have not in any way refused to help.  So all in all, the results\nare very encouraging, only you should certainly not draw any particular\nconclusions as all preliminary proceedings begin in the same way and it\nwas only the way they developed further that would show what the value\nof these preliminary proceedings has been.  Anyway, nothing has been\nlost yet, and if we can succeed in getting the office director, despite\neverything, on our side - and several actions have been undertaken to\nthis end - then everything is a clean wound, as a surgeon would say, and\nwe can wait for the results with some comfort.\n\n        When he started talking on in this way the lawyer was quite\ntireless.  He went through it all again every time K. went to see him.\nThere was always some progress, but he could never be told what sort of\nprogress it was.  The first set of documents to be submitted were being\nworked on but still not ready, which usually turned out to be a great\nadvantage the next time K. went to see him as the earlier occasion would\nhave been a very bad time to put them in, which they could not then have\nknown.  If K., stupefied from all this talking, ever pointed out that\neven considering all these difficulties progress was very slow, the\nlawyer would object that progress was not slow at all, but that they\nmight have progressed far further if K. had come to him at the right\ntime.  But he had come to him late and that lateness would bring still\nfurther difficulties, and not only where time was concerned.  The only\nwelcome interruption during these visits was always when Leni contrived\nto bring the lawyer his tea while K. was there.  Then she would stand\nbehind K. - pretending to watch the lawyer as he bent greedily over his\ncup, poured the tea in and drank - and secretly let K. hold her hand.\nThere was always complete silence.  The lawyer drank.  K. squeezed\nLeni's hand and Leni would sometimes dare to gently stroke K.'s hair.\n\"Still here, are you?\" the lawyer would ask when he was ready.  \"I\nwanted to take the dishes away,\" said Leni, they would give each other's\nhands a final squeeze, the lawyer would wipe his mouth and then start\ntalking at K. again with renewed energy.\n\n        Was the lawyer trying to comfort K. or to confuse him?  K. could\nnot tell, but it seemed clear to him that his defence was not in good\nhands.  Maybe everything the lawyer said was quite right, even though he\nobviously wanted to make himself as conspicuous as possible and probably\nhad never even taken on a case as important as he said K.'s was.  But it\nwas still suspicious how he continually mentioned his personal contacts\nwith the civil servants.  Were they to be exploited solely for K.'s\nbenefit?  The lawyer never forgot to mention that they were dealing only\nwith junior officials, which meant officials who were dependent on\nothers, and the direction taken in each trial could be important for\ntheir own furtherment.  Could it be that they were making use of the\nlawyer to turn trials in a certain direction, which would, of course,\nalways be at the cost of the defendant?  It certainly did not mean that\nthey would do that in every trial, that was not likely at all, and there\nwere probably also trials where they gave the lawyer advantages and all\nthe room he needed to turn it in the direction he wanted, as it would\nalso be to their advantage to keep his reputation intact.  If that\nreally was their relationship, how would they direct K.'s trial which,\nas the lawyer had explained, was especially difficult and therefore\nimportant enough to attract great attention from the very first time it\ncame to court?  There could not be much doubt about what they would do.\nThe first signs of it could already be seen in the fact that the first\ndocuments still had not been submitted even though the trial had already\nlasted several months, and that, according to the lawyer, everything was\nstill in its initial stages, which was very effective, of course, in\nmaking the defendant passive and keeping him helpless.  Then he could be\nsuddenly surprised with the verdict, or at least with a notification\nthat the hearing had not decided in his favour and the matter would be\npassed on to a higher office.\n\n        It was essential that K. take a hand in it himself.  On winter's\nmornings such as this, when he was very tired and everything dragged\nitself lethargically through his head, this belief of his seemed\nirrefutable.  He no longer felt the contempt for the trial that he had\nhad earlier.  If he had been alone in the world it would have been easy\nfor him to ignore it, although it was also certain that, in that case,\nthe trial would never have arisen in the first place.  But now, his\nuncle had already dragged him to see the lawyer, he had to take account\nof his family; his job was no longer totally separate from the progress\nof the trial, he himself had carelessly - with a certain, inexplicable\ncomplacency - mentioned it to acquaintances and others had learned about\nit in ways he did not know, his relationship with Miss Buerstner seemed\nto be in trouble because of it.  In short, he no longer had any choice\nwhether he would accept the trial or turn it down, he was in the middle\nof it and had to defend himself.  If he was tired, then that was bad.\n\n        But there was no reason to worry too much before he needed to.  He\nhad been capable of working himself up to his high position in the bank\nin a relatively short time and to retain it with respect from everyone,\nnow he simply had to apply some of the talents that had made that\npossible for him to the trial, and there was no doubt that it had to\nturn out well.  The most important thing, if something was to be\nachieved, was to reject in advance any idea that he might be in any way\nguilty.  There was no guilt.  The trial was nothing but a big piece of\nbusiness, just like he had already concluded to the benefit of the bank\nmany times, a piece of business that concealed many lurking dangers\nwaiting in ambush for him, as they usually did, and these dangers would\nneed to be defended against.  If that was to be achieved then he must\nnot entertain any idea of guilt, whatever he did, he would need to look\nafter his own interests as closely as he could.  Seen in this way, there\nwas no choice but to take his representation away from the lawyer very\nsoon, at best that very evening.  The lawyer had told him, as he talked\nto him, that that was something unheard of and would probably do him a\ngreat deal of harm, but K. could not tolerate any impediment to his\nefforts where his trial was concerned, and these impediments were\nprobably caused by the lawyer himself.  But once he had shaken off the\nlawyer the documents would need to be submitted straight away and, if\npossible, he would need to see to it that they were being dealt with\nevery day.  It would of course not be enough, if that was to be done,\nfor K. to sit in the corridor with his hat under the bench like the\nothers.  Day after day, he himself, or one of the women or somebody else\non his behalf, would have to run after the officials and force them to\nsit at their desks and study K.'s documents instead of looking out on\nthe corridor through the grating.  There could be no let-up in these\nefforts, everything would need to be organised and supervised, it was\nabout time that the court came up against a defendant who knew how to\ndefend and make use of his rights.\n\n        But when K. had the confidence to try and do all this the\ndifficulty of composing the documents was too much for him.  Earlier,\njust a week or so before, he could only have felt shame at the thought\nof being made to write out such documents himself;  it had never entered\nhis head that the task could also be difficult.  He remembered one\nmorning when, already piled up with work, he suddenly shoved everything\nto one side and took a pad of paper on which he sketched out some of his\nthoughts on how documents of this sort should proceed.  Perhaps he would\noffer them to that slow-witted lawyer, but just then the door of the\nmanager's office opened and the deputy-director entered the room with a\nloud laugh.  K. was very embarrassed, although the deputy-director, of\ncourse, was not laughing at K.'s documents, which he knew nothing about,\nbut at a joke he had just heard about the stock-exchange, a joke which\nneeded an illustration if it was to be understood, and now the deputy-\ndirector leant over K.'s desk, took his pencil from his hand, and drew\nthe illustration on the writing pad that K. had intended for his ideas\nabout his case.\n\n        K. now had no more thoughts of shame, the documents had to be\nprepared and submitted.  If, as was very likely, he could find no time\nto do it in the office he would have to do it at home at night.  If the\nnights weren't enough he would have to take a holiday.  Above all, he could\nnot stop half way, that was nonsense not only in business but always and\neverywhere.  Needless to say, the documents would mean an almost endless\namount of work.  It was easy to come to the belief, not only for those\nof an anxious disposition, that it was impossible ever to finish it.\nThis was not because of laziness or deceit, which were the only things\nthat might have hindered the lawyer in preparing it, but because he did\nnot know what the charge was or even what consequences it might bring,\nso that he had to remember every tiny action and event from the whole of\nhis life, looking at them from all sides and checking and reconsidering\nthem.  It was also a very disheartening job.  It would have been more\nsuitable as a way of passing the long days after he had retired and\nbecome senile.  But now, just when K. needed to apply all his thoughts\nto his work, when he was still rising and already posed a threat to the\ndeputy-director, when every hour passed so quickly and he wanted to\nenjoy the brief evenings and nights as a young man, this was the time he\nhad to start working out these documents.  Once more, he began to feel\nresentment.  Almost involuntarily, only to put an end to it, his finger\nfelt for the button of the electric bell in the ante-room.  As he\npressed it he glanced up to the clock.  It was eleven o'clock, two\nhours, he had spent a great deal of his costly time just dreaming and\nhis wits were, of course, even more dulled than they had been before.\nBut the time had, nonetheless, not been wasted, he had come to some\ndecisions that could be of value.  As well as various pieces of mail,\nthe servitors brought two visiting cards from gentlemen who had already\nbeen waiting for K. for some time.  They were actually very important\nclients of the bank who should not really have been kept waiting under\nany circumstances.  Why had they come at such an awkward time, and why,\nthe gentlemen on the other side of the closed door seemed to be asking,\nwas the industrious K. using up the best business time for his private\naffairs?  Tired from what had gone before, and tired in anticipation of\nwhat was to follow, K. stood up to receive the first of them.\n\n        He was a short, jolly man, a manufacturer who K. knew well.  He\napologised for disturbing K. at some important work, and K., for his\npart, apologised for having kept the manufacturer waiting for so long.\nBut even this apology was spoken in such a mechanical way and with such\nfalse intonation that the manufacturer would certainly have noticed if\nhe had not been fully preoccupied with his business affairs.  Instead,\nhe hurriedly pulled calculations and tables out from all his pockets,\nspread them out in front of K., explained several items, corrected a\nlittle mistake in the arithmetic that he noticed as he quickly glanced\nover it all, and reminded K. of a similar piece of business he'd\nconcluded with him about a year before, mentioning in passing that this\ntime there was another bank  spending great effort to get his business,\nand finally stopped speaking in order to learn K.'s opinion on the\nmatter.  And K. had indeed, at first, been closely following what the\nmanufacturer was saying, he too was aware of how important the deal was,\nbut unfortunately it did not last, he soon stopped listening, nodded at\neach of the manufacturer's louder exclamations for a short while, but\neventually he stopped doing even that and did no more than stare at the\nbald head bent over the papers, asking himself when the manufacturer\nwould finally realise that everything he was saying was useless.  When\nhe did stop talking, K. really thought at first that this was so that he\nwould have the chance to confess that he was incapable of listening.\nInstead, seeing the anticipation on the manufacturer's face, obviously\nready to counter any objections made, he was sorry to realise that the\nbusiness discussion had to be continued.  So he bent his head as if he'd\nbeen given an order and began slowly to move his pencil over the papers,\nnow and then he would stop and stare at one of the figures.  The\nmanufacturer thought there must be some objection, perhaps his figures\nweren't really sound, perhaps they weren't the decisive issue, whatever\nhe thought, the manufacturer covered the papers with his hand and began\nonce again, moving very close to K., to explain what the deal was all\nabout.  \"It is difficult,\" said K., pursing his lips. The only thing\nthat could offer him any guidance were the papers, and the manufacturer\nhad covered them from his view, so he just sank back against the arm of\nthe chair.  Even when the door of the manager's office opened and\nrevealed not very clearly, as if through a veil, the deputy director, he\ndid no more than look up weakly.  K. thought no more about the matter,\nhe merely watched the immediate effect of the deputy director's\nappearance and, for him, the effect was very pleasing;  the manufacturer\nimmediately jumped up from his seat and hurried over to meet the deputy\ndirector, although K. would have liked to make him ten times livelier as\nhe feared the deputy director might disappear again.  He need not have\nworried, the two gentlemen met each other, shook each other's hand and\nwent together over to K.'s desk.  The manufacturer said he was sorry to\nfind the chief clerk so little inclined to do business, pointing to K.\nwho, under the view of the deputy director, had bent back down over the\npapers.  As the two men leant over the desk and the manufacturer made\nsome effort to gain and keep the deputy director's attention, K. felt as\nif they were much bigger than they really were and that their\nnegotiations were about him.  Carefully and slowly turning his eyes\nupwards, he tried to learn what was taking place above him, took one of\nthe papers from his desk without looking to see what it was, lay it on\nthe flat of his hand and raised it slowly up as he rose up to the level\nof the two men himself.  He had no particular plan in mind as he did\nthis, but merely felt this was how he would act if only he had finished\npreparing that great document that was to remove his burden entirely.\nThe deputy director had been paying all his attention to the\nconversation and did no more than glance at the paper, he did not read\nwhat was written on it at all as what was important for the chief clerk\nwas not important for him, he took it from K.'s hand saying, \"Thank you,\nI'm already familiar with everything\", and lay it calmly back on the\ndesk.  K. gave him a bitter, sideways look.  But the deputy director did\nnot notice this at all, or if he did notice it it only raised his\nspirits, he frequently laughed out loud, one time he clearly embarrassed\nthe manufacturer when he raised an objection in a witty way but drew him\nimmediately back out of his embarrassment by commenting adversely on\nhimself, and finally invited him into his office where they could bring\nthe matter to its conclusion.  \"It's a very important matter,\" said the\nmanufacturer.  \"I understand that completely.  And I'm sure the chief\nclerk ...\" - even as he said this he was actually speaking only to the\nmanufacturer - \"will be very glad to have us take it off his hands.\nThis is something that needs calm consideration.  But he seems to be\nover-burdened today, there are even some people in the room outside\nwho've been waiting there for hours for him.\"  K. still had enough\ncontrol of himself to turn away from the deputy director and direct his\nfriendly, albeit stiff, smile only at the manufacturer, he made no other\nretaliation, bent down slightly and supported himself with both hands on\nhis desk like a clerk, and watched as the two gentlemen, still talking,\ntook the papers from his desk and disappeared into the manager's office.\nIn the doorway, the manufacturer turned and said he wouldn't make his\nfarewell with K. just yet, he would of course let the chief clerk know\nabout the success of his discussions but he also had a little something\nto tell him about.\n\n        At last, K. was by himself.  It did not enter his head to show\nanyone else into his office and only became vaguely aware of how nice it\nwas that the people outside thought he was still negotiating with the\nmanufacturer and, for this reason, he could not let anyone in to see\nhim, not even the servitor.  He went over to the window, sat down on the\nledge beside it, held firmly on to the handle and looked down onto the\nsquare outside.  The snow was still falling, the weather still had not\nbrightened up at all.\n\n        He remained a long time sitting in this way, not knowing what it\nactually was that made him so anxious, only occasionally did he glance,\nslightly startled, over his shoulder at the door to the outer room\nwhere, mistakenly, he thought he'd heard some noise.  No-one came, and\nthat made him feel calmer, he went over to the wash stand, rinsed his\nface with cold water and, his head somewhat clearer, went back to his\nplace by the window.  The decision to take his defence into his own\nhands now seemed more of a burden than he had originally assumed.  All\nthe while he had left his defence up to the lawyer his trial had had\nlittle basic affect on him, he had observed it from afar as something\nthat was scarcely able to reach him directly, when it suited him he\nlooked to see how things stood but he was also able to draw his head\nback again whenever he wanted.  Now, in contrast, if he was to conduct\nhis defence himself, he would have to devote himself entirely to the\ncourt - for the time being, at least - success would mean, later on, his\ncomplete and conclusive liberation, but if he was to achieve this he\nwould have to place himself, to start with, in far greater danger than\nhe had been in so far.  If he ever felt tempted to doubt this, then his\nexperience with the deputy director and the manufacturer that day would\nbe quite enough to convince him of it.  How could he have sat there\ntotally convinced of the need to do his own defence?  How would it be\nlater?  What would his life be like in the days ahead?  Would he find\nthe way through it all to a happy conclusion?  Did a carefully worked\nout defence - and any other sort would have made no sense - did a\ncarefully worked out defence not also mean he would need to shut himself\noff from everything else as much as he could?  Would he survive that?\nAnd how was he to succeed in conducting all this at the bank?  It\ninvolved much more than just submitting some documents that he could\nprobably prepare in a few days' leave, although it would have been great\ntemerity to ask for time off from the bank just at that time, it was a\nwhole trial and there was no way of seeing how long it might last.  This\nwas an enormous difficulty that had suddenly been thrown into K.'s life!\n\n        And was he supposed to be doing the bank's work at a time like\nthis?  He looked down at his desk.  Was he supposed to let people in to\nsee him and go into negotiations with them at a time like this?  While\nhis trial trundled on, while the court officials upstairs in the attic\nroom sat looking at the papers for this trial, should he be worrying\nabout the business of the bank?  Did this not seem like a kind of\ntorture, acknowledged by the court, connected with the trial and which\nfollowed him around?  And is it likely that anyone in the bank, when\njudging his work, would take any account of his peculiar situation?  No-\none and never.  There were those who knew about his trial, although it\nwas not quite clear who knew about it or how much.  But he hoped rumours\nhad not reached as far as the deputy director, otherwise he would\nobviously soon find a way of making use of it to harm K., he would show\nneither comradeship nor humaneness.  And what about the director?  It\nwas true that he was well disposed towards K., and as soon as he heard\nabout the trial he would probably try to do everything he could to make\nit easier for him, but he would certainly not devote himself to it.  K.\nat one time had provided the counter-balance to what the deputy director\nsaid but the director was now coming more and more under his influence,\nand the deputy director would also exploit the weakened condition of the\ndirector to strengthen his own power.  So what could K. hope for?  Maybe\nconsiderations of this sort weakened his power of resistance, but it was\nstill necessary not to deceive oneself and to see everything as clearly\nas it could be seen at that moment.\n\n        For no particular reason, just to avoiding returning to his desk\nfor a while, he opened the window.  It was difficult to open and he had\nto turn the handle with both his hands.  Then, through the whole height\nand breadth of the window, the mixture of fog and smoke was drawn into\nthe room, filling it with a slight smell of burning.  A few flakes of\nsnow were blown in with it.  \"It's a horrible autumn,\" said the\nmanufacturer, who had come into the room unnoticed after seeing the\ndeputy director and now stood behind K.  K. nodded and looked uneasily\nat the manufacturer's briefcase, from which he would now probably take\nthe papers and inform K. of the result of his negotiations with the\ndeputy director.  However, the manufacturer saw where K. was looking,\nknocked on his briefcase and without opening it said, \"You'll be wanting\nto hear how things turned out.  I've already got the contract in my\npocket, almost.  He's a charming man, your deputy director - he's got\nhis dangers, though.\"  He laughed as he shook K.'s hand and wanted to\nmake him laugh with him.  But to K., it once more seemed suspicious that\nthe manufacturer did not want to show him the papers and saw nothing\nabout his comments to laugh at.  \"Chief clerk,\" said the manufacturer,\n\"I expect the weather's been affecting your mood, has it? You're looking\nso worried today.\"   \"Yes,\" said K., raising his hand and holding the\ntemple of his head, \"headaches, worries in the family.\"  \"Quite right,\"\nsaid the manufacturer, who was always in a hurry and could never listen\nto anyone for very long, \"everyone has his cross to bear.\"  K. had\nunconsciously made a step towards the door as if wanting to show the\nmanufacturer out, but the manufacturer said, \"Chief clerk, there's\nsomething else I'd like to mention to you.  I'm very sorry if it's\nsomething that'll be a burden to you today of all days but I've been to\nsee you twice already, lately, and each time I forgot all about it.  If\nI delay it any longer it might well lose its point altogether.  That\nwould be a pity, as I think what I've got to say does have some value.\"\nBefore K. had had the time to answer, the manufacturer came up close to\nhim, tapped his knuckle lightly on his chest and said quietly, \"You've\ngot a trial going on, haven't you?\"  K. stepped back and immediately\nexclaimed, \"That's what the deputy director's been telling you!\"  \"No,\nno,\" said the manufacturer, \"how would the deputy director know about\nit?\"  \"And what about you?\" asked K., already more in control of\nhimself.  \"I hear things about the court here and there,\" said the\nmanufacturer, \"and that even applies to what it is that I wanted to tell\nyou about.\"  \"There are so many people who have connections with the\ncourt!\" said K. with lowered head, and he led the manufacturer over to\nhis desk.  They sat down where they had been before, and the\nmanufacturer said, \"I'm afraid it's not very much that I've got to tell\nyou about.  Only, in matters like this, it's best not to overlook the\ntiniest details.  Besides, I really want to help you in some way,\nhowever modest my help might be.  We've been good business partners up\ntill now, haven't we?  Well then.\"  K. wanted to apologise for his\nbehaviour in the conversation earlier that day, but the manufacturer\nwould tolerate no interruption, shoved his briefcase up high in his\narmpit to show that he was in a hurry, and carried on.  \"I know about\nyour case through a certain Titorelli.  He's a painter, Titorelli's just\nhis artistic name, I don't even know what his real name is.  He's been\ncoming to me in my office for years from time to time, and brings little\npictures with him which I buy more or less just for the sake of charity\nas he's hardly more than a beggar.  And they're nice pictures, too,\nmoorland landscapes and that sort of thing.  We'd both got used to doing\nbusiness in this way and it always went smoothly.  Only, one time these\nvisits became a bit too frequent, I began to tell him off for it, we\nstarted talking and I became interested how it was that he could earn a\nliving just by painting, and then I learned to my amazement that his\nmain source of income was painting portraits.  'I work for the court,'\nhe said, 'what court?' said I.  And that's when he told me about the\ncourt.  I'm sure you can imagine how amazed I was at being told all\nthis.  Ever since then I learn something new about the court every time\nhe comes to visit, and so little by little I get to understand something\nof how it works.  Anyway, Titorelli talks a lot and I often have to push\nhim away, not only because he's bound to be lying but also, most of all,\nbecause a businessman like me who's already close to breaking point\nunder the weight of his own business worries can't pay too much\nattention to other people's.  But all that's just by the by.  Perhaps -\nthis is what I've been thinking - perhaps Titorelli might be able to\nhelp you in some small way, he knows lots of judges and even if he can't\nhave much influence himself he can give you some advice about how to get\nsome influential people on your side.  And even if this advice doesn't\nturn out to make all the difference I still think it'll be very\nimportant once you've got it.  You're nearly a lawyer yourself.  That's\nwhat I always say, Mr. K. the chief clerk is nearly a lawyer.  Oh I'm\nsure this trial of yours will turn out all right.  So do you want to go\nand see Titorelli, then?  If I ask him to he'll certainly do everything\nhe possibly can.  I really do think you ought to go.  It needn't be\ntoday, of course, just some time, when you get the chance.  And anyway -\nI want to tell you this too -  you don't actually have to go and see\nTitorelli, this advice from me doesn't place you under any obligation at\nall.  No, if you think you can get by without Titorelli it'll certainly\nbe better to leave him completely out of it.  Maybe you've already got a\nclear idea of what you're doing and Titorelli could upset your plans.\nNo, if that's the case then of course you shouldn't go there under any\ncircumstances!  And it certainly won't be easy to take advice from a lad\nlike that.  Still, it's up to you.  Here's the letter of recommendation\nand here's the address.\"\n\n        Disappointed, K. took the letter and put it in his pocket.  Even\nat best, the advantage he might derive from this recommendation was\nincomparably smaller than the damage that lay in the fact of the\nmanufacturer knowing about his trial, and that the painter was spreading\nthe news about.  It was all he could manage to give the manufacturer, who\nwas already on his way to the door, a few words of thanks.  \"I'll go\nthere,\" he said as he took his leave of the manufacturer at the door,\n\"or, as I'm very busy at present, I'll write to him, perhaps he would\nlike to come to me in my office some time.\"  \"I was sure you'd find the\nbest solution,\" said the manufacturer.  \"Although I had thought you'd\nprefer to avoid inviting people like this Titorelli to the bank and\ntalking about the trial here.  And it's not always a good idea to send\nletters to people like Titorelli, you don't know what might happen to\nthem.  But you're bound to have thought everything through and you know\nwhat you can and can't do.\"  K. nodded and accompanied the manufacturer\non through the ante-room.  But despite seeming calm on the outside he\nwas actually very shocked; he had told the manufacturer he would write\nto Titorelli only to show him in some way that he valued his\nrecommendations and would consider the opportunity to speak with\nTitorelli without delay, but if he had thought Titorelli could offer any\nworthwhile assistance he would not have delayed.  But it was only the\nmanufacturer's comment that made K. realise what dangers that could lead\nto.  Was he really able to rely on his own understanding so little?  If\nit was possible that he might invite a questionable character into the\nbank with a clear letter, and ask advice from him about his trial,\nseparated from the deputy director by no more than a door, was it not\npossible or even very likely that there were also other dangers he had\nfailed to see or that he was even running towards?  There was not always\nsomeone beside him to warn him.  And just now, just when he would have\nto act with all the strength he could muster, now a number of doubts of\na sort he had never before known had presented themselves and affected\nhis own vigilance!  The difficulties he had been feeling in carrying out\nhis office work; were they now going to affect the trial too?  Now, at\nleast, he found himself quite unable to understand how he could have\nintended to write to Titorelli and invite him into the bank.\n\n        He shook his head at the thought of it once more as the servitor\ncame up beside him and drew his attention to the three gentlemen who\nwere waiting on a bench in the ante-room.  They had already been waiting\nto see K. for a long time.  Now that the servitor was speaking with K.\nthey had stood up and each of them wanted to make use of the opportunity\nto see K. before the others.  It had been negligent of the bank to let\nthem waste their time here in the waiting room, but none of them wanted\nto draw attention to this.  \"Mr. K., ...\" one of them was saying, but K.\nhad told the servitor to fetch his winter coat and said to the three of\nthem, as the servitor helped him to put it on, \"Please forgive me,\ngentlemen, I'm afraid I have no time to see you at present.  Please do\nforgive me but I have some urgent business to settle and have to leave\nstraight away.  You've already seen yourselves how long I've been\ndelayed.  Would you be so kind as to come back tomorrow or some time?\nOr perhaps we could settle your affairs by telephone?  Or perhaps you\nwould like to tell me now, briefly, what it's about and I can then give\nyou a full answer in writing.  Whatever, the best thing will be for you\nto come here again.\"   The gentlemen now saw that their wait had been\ntotally pointless, and these suggestions of K.'s left them so astounded\nthat they looked at each other without a word.  \"That's agreed then, is\nit?\" asked K., who had turned toward the servitor bringing him his hat.\nThrough the open door of K.'s office they could see that the snowfall\noutside had become much heavier.  So K. turned the collar of his coat up\nand buttoned it up high under his chin.  Just then the deputy director\ncame out of the adjoining room, smiled as he saw K. negotiating with the\ngentlemen in his winter coat, and asked, \"Are you about to go out?\"\n\"Yes,\" said K., standing more upright, \"I have to go out on some\nbusiness.\"  But the deputy director had already turned towards the\ngentlemen.  \"And what about these gentlemen?\" he asked.  \"I think\nthey've already been waiting quite a long time.\"  \"We've already come to\nan understanding,\" said K.  But now the gentlemen could be held back no\nlonger, they surrounded K. and explained that they would not have been\nwaiting for hours if it had not been about something important that had\nto be discussed now, at length and in private.  The deputy director\nlistened to them for a short while, he also looked at K. as he held his\nhat in his hand cleaning the dust off it here and there, and then he\nsaid, \"Gentlemen, there is a very simple way to solve this.  If you\nwould prefer it, I'll be very glad to take over these negotiations\ninstead of the chief clerk.  Your business does, of course, need to be\ndiscussed without delay.  We are businessmen like yourselves and know\nthe value of a businessman's time.  Would you like to come this way?\"\nAnd he opened the door leading to the ante-room of his own office.\n\n        The deputy director seemed very good at appropriating everything\nthat K. was now forced to give up!  But was K. not giving up more than\nhe absolutely had to?  By running off to some unknown painter, with, as\nhe had to admit, very little hope of any vague benefit, his renown was\nsuffering damage that could not me repaired.  It would probably be much\nbetter to take off his winter coat again and, at the very least, try to\nwin back the two gentlemen who were certainly still waiting in the next\nroom.  If K. had not then glimpsed the deputy director in his office,\nlooking for something from his bookshelves as if they were his own, he\nwould probably even have made the attempt.  As K., somewhat agitated,\napproached the door the deputy director called out, \"Oh, you've still\nnot left!\"  He turned his face toward him - its many deep folds seemed\nto show strength rather than age - and immediately began once more to\nsearch.  \"I'm looking for a copy of a contract,\" he said, \"which this\ngentleman  insists you must have.  Could you help me look for it, do you\nthink?\"  K. made a step forward, but the deputy director said, \"thank\nyou, I've already found it,\" and with a big package of papers, which\ncertainly must have included many more documents than just the copy of\nthe contract, he turned and went back into his own office.\n\n        \"I can't deal with him right now,\" K. said to himself, \"but once\nmy personal difficulties have been settled, then he'll certainly be the\nfirst to get the effect of it, and he certainly won't like it.\"\nSlightly calmed by these thoughts, K. gave the servitor, who had already\nlong been holding the door to the corridor open for him, the task of\ntelling the director, when he was able, that K. was going out of the\nbank on a business matter.  As he left the bank he felt almost happy at\nthe thought of being able to devote more of himself to his own business\nfor a while.\n\n        He went straight to the painter, who lived in an outlying part of\ntown which was very near to the court offices, although this area was\neven poorer, the houses were darker, the streets were full of dirt that\nslowly blew about over the half-melted snow.   In the great gateway to\nthe building where the painter lived only one of the two doors was open,\na hole had been broken open in the wall by the other door, and as K.\napproached it a repulsive, yellow, steaming liquid shot out causing some\nrats to scurry away into the nearby canal.  Down by the staircase there\nwas a small child lying on its belly crying, but it could hardly be\nheard because of the noise from a metal-workshop on the other side of\nthe entrance hall, drowning out any other sound.  The door to the\nworkshop was open, three workers stood in a circle around some piece of\nwork that they were beating with hammers.  A large tin plate hung on the\nwall, casting a pale light that pushed its way in between two of the\nworkers, lighting up their faces and their work-aprons.  K. did no more\nthan glance at any of these things, he wanted to get things over with\nhere as soon as possible, to exchange just a few words to find out how\nthings stood with the painter and go straight back to the bank.  Even if\nhe had just some tiny success here it would still have a good effect on\nhis work at the bank for that day.  On the third floor he had to slow\ndown his pace, he was quite out of breath - the steps, just like the\nheight of each floor, were much higher than they needed to be and he'd\nbeen told that the painter lived right up in the attic.  The air was\nalso quite oppressive, there was no proper stairwell and the narrow\nsteps were closed in by walls on both sides with no more than a small,\nhigh window here and there.  Just as K. paused for a while some young\ngirls ran out of one of the flats and rushed higher up the stairs,\nlaughing.  K. followed them slowly, caught up with one of the girls who\nhad stumbled and been left behind by the others, and asked her as they\nwent up side by side, \"Is there a painter, Titorelli, who lives here?\"\nThe girl, hardly thirteen years old and somewhat hunchbacked, jabbed him\nwith her elbow and looked at him sideways.  Her youth and her bodily\ndefects had done nothing to stop her being already quite depraved.  She\ndid not smile once, but looked at K. earnestly, with sharp, acquisitive\neyes.  K. pretended not to notice her behaviour and asked, \"Do you know\nTitorelli, the painter?\"  She nodded and asked in reply,  \"What d'you\nwant to see him for?\"  K. thought it would be to his advantage quickly\nto find out something more about Titorelli.  \"I want to have him paint\nmy portrait,\" he said.  \"Paint your portrait?\" she asked, opening her\nmouth too wide and lightly hitting K. with her hand as if he had said\nsomething extraordinarily surprising or clumsy, with both hands she\nlifted her skirt, which was already very short, and, as fast as she\ncould, she ran off after the other girls whose indistinct shouts lost\nthemselves in the heights.  At the next turn of the stairs, however, K.\nencountered all the girls once more.  The hunchbacked girl had clearly\ntold them about K.'s intentions and they were waiting for him.  They\nstood on both sides of the stairs, pressing themselves against the wall\nso that K. could get through between them, and smoothed their aprons\ndown with their hands.  All their faces, even in this guard of honour,\nshowed a mixture of childishness and depravity.  Up at the head of the\nline of girls, who now, laughing, began to close in around K., was the\nhunchback who had taken on the role of leader.  It was thanks to her\nthat K. found the right direction without delay - he would have\ncontinued up the stairs straight in front of him, but she showed him\nthat to reach Titorelli he would need to turn off to one side.\nThe steps that led up to the painter were especially narrow, very long\nwithout any turning, the whole length could be seen in one glance and,\nat the top, at Titorelli's closed door, it came to its end.   This door\nwas much better illuminated than the rest of the stairway by the light\nfrom a small skylight set obliquely above it, it had been put together\nfrom unpainted planks of wood and the name 'Titorelli' was painted on it\nin broad, red brushstrokes.  K. was no more than half way up the steps,\naccompanied by his retinue of girls, when, clearly the result of the\nnoise of all those footsteps, the door opened slightly and in the crack\na man who seemed to be dressed in just his nightshirt appeared.  \"Oh!\"\nhe cried, when he saw the approaching crowd, and vanished.  The\nhunchbacked girl clapped her hands in glee and the other girls crowded\nin behind K. to push him faster forward.\n\n        They still had not arrived at the top, however, when the painter\nup above them suddenly pulled the door wide open and, with a deep bow,\ninvited K. to enter.  The girls, on the other hand, he tried to keep\naway, he did not want to let any of them in however much they begged him\nand however much they tried to get in - if they could not get in with\nhis permission they would try to force their way in against his will.\nThe only one to succeed was the hunchback when she slipped through under\nhis outstretched arm, but the painter chased after her, grabbed her by\nthe skirt, span her once round and set her down again by the door with\nthe other girls who, unlike the first, had not dared to cross the\ndoorstep while the painter had left his post.   K. did not know what he\nwas to make of all this, as they all seemed to be having fun.  One\nbehind the other, the girls by the door stretched their necks up high\nand called out various words to the painter which were meant in jest but\nwhich K. did not understand, and even the painter laughed as the\nhunchback whirled round in his hand.  Then he shut the door, bowed once\nmore to K., offered him his hand and introduced himself, saying,\n\"Titorelli, painter\".  K. pointed to the door, behind which the girls\nwere whispering, and said, \"You seem to be very popular in this\nbuilding.\"  \"Ach, those brats!\" said the painter, trying in vain to\nfasten his nightshirt at the neck.  He was also bare-footed and, apart\nfrom that, was wearing nothing more than a loose pair of yellowish linen\ntrousers held up with a belt whose free end whipped to and fro.  \"Those\nkids are a real burden for me,\" he continued.  The top button of his\nnightshirt came off and he gave up trying to fasten it, fetched a chair\nfor K. and made him sit down on it.  \"I painted one of them once - she's\nnot here today - and ever since then they've been following me about.\nIf I'm here they only come in when I allow it, but as soon as I've gone\nout there's always at least one of them in here.  They had a key made to\nmy door and lend it round to each other.  It's hard to imagine what a\npain that is.  Suppose I come back home with a lady I'm going to paint,\nI open the door with my own key and find the hunchback there or\nsomething, by the table painting her lips red with my paintbrush, and\nmeanwhile her little sisters will be keeping guard for her, moving about\nand causing chaos in every corner of the room.  Or else, like happened\nyesterday, I might come back home late in the evening - please forgive\nmy appearance and the room being in a mess, it is to do with them - so,\nI might come home late in the evening and want to go to bed, then I feel\nsomething pinching my leg, look under the bed and pull another of them\nout from under it.  I don't know why it is they bother me like this, I\nexpect you've just seen that I do nothing to encourage them to come near\nme.  And they make it hard for me to do my work too, of course.  If I\ndidn't get this studio for nothing I'd have moved out a long time ago.\"\nJust then, a little voice, tender and anxious, called out from under the\ndoor, \"Titorelli, can we come in now?\"  \"No,\" answered the painter.\n\"Not even just me, by myself?\" the voice asked again.  \"Not even just\nyou,\" said the painter, as he went to the door and locked it.\n\n        Meanwhile, K. had been looking round the room, if it had not been\npointed out it would never have occurred to him that this wretched\nlittle room could be called a studio.  It was hardly long enough or\nbroad enough to make two steps.  Everything, floor, walls and ceiling,\nwas made of wood, between the planks narrow gaps could be seen.  Across\nfrom where K. was, the bed stood against the wall under a covering of\nmany different colours.  In the middle of the room a picture stood on an\neasel, covered over with a shirt whose arms dangled down to the ground.\nBehind K. was the window through which the fog made it impossible to see\nfurther than the snow covered roof of the neighbouring building.\n\n        The turning of the key in the lock reminded K. that he had not\nwanted to stay too long.  So he drew the manufacturer's letter out from\nhis pocket, held it out to the painter and said, \"I learned about you\nfrom this gentleman, an acquaintance of yours, and it's on  his advice\nthat I've come here\".  The painter glanced through the letter and threw\nit down onto the bed.  If the manufacturer had not said very clearly\nthat Titorelli was an acquaintance of his, a poor man who was dependent\non his charity, then it would really have been quite possible to believe\nthat Titorelli did not know him or at least that he could not remember\nhim.  This impression was augmented by the painter's asking, \"Were you\nwanting to buy some pictures or did you want to have yourself painted?\"\nK. looked at the painter in astonishment.  What did the letter actually\nsay?  K. had taken it as a matter of course that the manufacturer had\nexplained to the painter in his letter that K. wanted nothing more with\nhim than to find out more about his trial.  He had been far too rash in\ncoming here!  But now he had to give the painter some sort of answer\nand, glancing at the easel, said, \"Are you working on a picture\ncurrently?\"  \"Yes,\" said the painter, and he took the shirt hanging over\nthe easel and threw it onto the bed after the letter.  \"It's a portrait.\nQuite a good piece of work, although it's not quite finished yet.\"  This\nwas a convenient coincidence for K., it gave him a good opportunity to\ntalk about the court as the picture showed, very clearly, a judge.\nWhat's more, it was remarkably similar to the picture in the lawyer's\noffice, although this one showed a quite different judge, a heavy man\nwith a full beard which was black and bushy and extended to the sides\nfar up the man's cheeks.  The lawyer's picture was also an oil painting,\nwhereas this one had been made with pastel colours and was pale and\nunclear.  But everything else about the picture was similar, as this\njudge, too, was holding tightly to the arm of his throne and seemed\nominously about to rise from it.  At first K. was about to say, \"He\ncertainly is a judge,\" but he held himself back for the time being and\nwent closer to the picture as if he wanted to study it in detail.  There\nwas a large figure shown in middle of the throne's back rest which K.\ncould not understand and asked the painter about it.  That'll need some\nmore work done on it, the painter told him, and taking a pastel crayon\nfrom a small table he added a few strokes to the edges of the figure but\nwithout making it any clearer as far as K. could make out.  \"That's the\nfigure of justice,\" said the painter, finally.  \"Now I see,\" said K.,\n\"here's the blindfold and here are the scales.  But aren't those wings\non her heels, and isn't she moving?\"  \"Yes,\" said the painter, \"I had to\npaint it like that according to the contract.  It's actually the figure\nof justice and the goddess of victory all in one.\"  \"That is not a good\ncombination,\" said K. with a smile.  \"Justice needs to remain still,\notherwise the scales will move about and it won't be possible to make a\njust verdict.\"  \"I'm just doing what the client wanted,\" said the\npainter.  \"Yes, certainly,\" said K., who had not meant to criticise\nanyone by that comment.  \"You've painted the figure as it actually\nappears on the throne.\"  \"No,\"  said the painter, \"I've never seen that\nfigure or that throne, it's all just invention, but they told me what it\nwas I had to paint.\"  \"How's that?\" asked K. pretending not fully to\nunderstand what the painter said.  \"That is a judge sitting on the\njudge's chair, isn't it?\"  \"Yes,\" said the painter, \"but that judge\nisn't very high up and he's never sat on any throne like that.\"  \"And he\nhas himself painted in such a grand pose?  He's sitting there just like\nthe president of the court.\"  \"Yeah, gentlemen like this are very vain,\"\nsaid the painter.  \"But they have permission from higher up to get\nthemselves painted like this.  It's laid down quite strictly just what\nsort of portrait each of them can get for himself.  Only it's a pity\nthat you can't make out the details of his costume and pose in this\npicture, pastel colours aren't really suitable for showing people like\nthis.\"  \"Yes,\" said K., \"it does seem odd that it's in pastel colours.\"\n\"That's what the judge wanted,\" said the painter, \"it's meant to be for\na woman.\"  The sight of the picture seemed to make him feel like\nworking, he rolled up his shirtsleeves, picked up a few of the crayons,\nand K. watched as a reddish shadow built up around the head of the judge\nunder their quivering tips and radiated out the to edges of the picture.\nThis shadow play slowly surrounded the head like a decoration or lofty\ndistinction.  But around the figure of Justice, apart from some\ncoloration that was barely noticeable, it remained light, and in this\nbrightness the figure seemed to shine forward so that it now looked like\nneither the God of Justice nor the God of Victory, it seemed now,\nrather, to be a perfect depiction of the God of the Hunt.  K. found the\npainter's work more engrossing than he had wanted; but finally he\nreproached himself for staying so long without having done anything\nrelevant to his own affair.  \"What's the name of this judge?\" he asked\nsuddenly.  \"I'm not allowed to tell you that,\" the painter answered.  He\nwas bent deeply over the picture and clearly neglecting his guest who,\nat first, he had received with such care.  K. took this to be just a\nfoible of the painter's, and it irritated him as it made him lose time.\n\"I take it you must be a trustee of the court,\" he said.  The painter\nimmediately put his crayons down, stood upright, rubbed his hands\ntogether and looked at K. with a smile.  \"Always straight out with the\ntruth,\" he said. \"You want to learn something about the court, like it\nsays in your letter of recommendation, but then you start talking about\nmy pictures to get me on your side.  Still, I won't hold it against you,\nyou weren't to know that that was entirely the wrong thing to try with\nme. Oh, please!\" he said sharply, repelling K.'s attempt to make some\nobjection.  He then continued, \"And besides, you're quite right in your\ncomment that I'm a trustee of the court.\"  He made a pause, as if\nwanting to give K. the time to come to terms with this fact.  The girls\ncould once more be heard from behind the door.  They were probably\npressed around the keyhole, perhaps they could even see into the room\nthrough the gaps in the planks.  K. forewent the opportunity to excuse\nhimself in some way as he did not wish to distract the painter from what\nhe was saying, or else perhaps he didn't want him to get too far above\nhimself and in this way make himself to some extent unattainable, so he\nasked, \"Is that a publicly acknowledged position?\"  \"No,\" was the\npainter's curt reply, as if the question prevented him saying any more.\nBut K. wanted him to continue speaking and said, \"Well, positions like\nthat, that aren't officially acknowledged, can often have more influence\nthan those that are.\"  \"And that's how it is with me,\" said the painter,\nand nodded with a frown.  \"I was talking about your case with the\nmanufacturer yesterday, and he asked me if I wouldn't like to help you,\nand I answered: 'He can come and see me if he likes', and now I'm\npleased to see you here so soon.  This business seems to be quite\nimportant to you, and, of course, I'm not surprised at that.  Would you\nnot like to take your coat off now?\"  K. had intended to stay for only a\nvery short time, but the painter's invitation was nonetheless very\nwelcome.  The air in the room had slowly become quite oppressive for\nhim, he had several times looked in amazement at a small, iron stove in\nthe corner that certainly could not have been lit, the heat of the room\nwas inexplicable.  As he took off his winter overcoat and also\nunbuttoned his frock coat the painter said to him in apology, \"I must\nhave warmth.  And it is very cosy here, isn't it.  This room's very good\nin that respect.\"  K. made no reply, but it was actually not the heat\nthat made him uncomfortable but, much more, the stuffiness, the air that\nalmost made it more difficult to breathe, the room had probably not been\nventilated for a long time.  The unpleasantness of this was made all the\nstronger for K. when the painter invited him to sit on the bed while he\nhimself sat down on the only chair in the room in front of the easel.\nThe painter even seemed to misunderstand why K. remained at the edge of\nthe bed and urged K. to make himself comfortable, and as he hesitated he\nwent over to the bed himself and pressed K. deep down into the\nbedclothes and pillows.  Then he went back to his seat and at last he\nasked his first objective question, which made K. forget everything\nelse.  \"You're innocent, are you?\" he asked.  \"Yes,\" said K.  He felt a\nsimple joy at answering this question, especially as the answer was\ngiven to a private individual and therefore would have no consequences.\nUp till then no-one had asked him this question so openly.  To make the\nmost of his pleasure he added, \"I am totally innocent.\"  \"So,\" said the\npainter, and he lowered his head and seemed to be thinking.  Suddenly he\nraised his head again and said, \"Well if you're innocent it's all very\nsimple.\"  K. began to scowl, this supposed trustee of the court was\ntalking like an ignorant child.  \"My being innocent does not make things\nsimple,\" said K.  Despite everything, he couldn't help smiling and\nslowly shook his head.  \"There are many fine details in which the court\ngets lost, but in the end it reaches into some place where originally\nthere was nothing and pulls enormous guilt out of it.\"  \"Yeah, yeah,\nsure,\" said the painter, as if K. had been disturbing his train of\nthought for no reason.  \"But you are innocent, aren't you?\"  \"Well of\ncourse I am,\" said K.  \"That's the main thing,\" said the painter.  There\nwas no counter-argument that could influence him, but although he had\nmade up his mind it was not clear whether he was talking this way\nbecause of conviction or indifference.  K., then, wanted to find out and\nsaid therefore, \"I'm sure you're more familiar with the court than I am,\nI know hardly more about it than what I've heard, and that's been from\nmany very different people.  But they were all agreed on one thing, and\nthat was that when ill thought-out accusations are made they are not\nignored, and that once the court has made an accusation it is convinced\nof the guilt of the defendant and it's very hard to make it think\notherwise.\"  \"Very hard?\" the painter asked, throwing one hand up in the\nair.  \"It's impossible to make it think otherwise.  If I painted all the\njudges next to each other here on canvas, and you were trying to defend\nyourself in front of it, you'd have more success with them than you'd\never have with the real court.\"  \"Yes,\" said K. to himself, forgetting\nthat he had only gone there to investigate the painter.\n\n        One of the girls behind the door started up again, and asked,\n\"Titorelli, is he going to go soon?\"  \"Quiet!\" shouted the painter at\nthe door, \"Can't you see I'm talking with the gentleman?\"  But this was\nnot enough to satisfy the girl and she asked, \"You going to paint his\npicture?\"  And when the painter didn't answer she added, \"Please don't\npaint him, he's an 'orrible bloke.\"  There followed an incomprehensible,\ninterwoven babble of shouts and replies and calls of agreement.  The\npainter leapt over to the door, opened it very slightly - the girls'\nclasped hands could be seen stretching through the crack as if they\nwanted something - and said, \"If you're not quiet I'll throw you all\ndown the stairs.  Sit down here on the steps and be quiet.\"  They\nprobably did not obey him immediately, so that he had to command, \"Down\non the steps!\"  Only then it became quiet.\n\n        \"I'm sorry about that,\" said the painter as he returned to K.  K.\nhad hardly turned towards the door, he had left it completely up to the\npainter whether and how he would place him under his protection if he\nwanted to.  Even now, he made hardly any movement as the painter bent\nover him and, whispering into his ear in order not to be heard outside,\nsaid, \"These girls belong to the court as well.\"  \"How's that?\" asked\nK., as he leant his head to one side and looked at the painter.  But the\npainter sat back down on his chair and, half in jest, half in\nexplanation, \"Well, everything belongs to the court.\"  \"That is\nsomething I had never noticed until now,\" said K. curtly, this general\ncomment of the painter's made his comment about the girls far less\ndisturbing.  Nonetheless, K. looked for a while at the door, behind\nwhich the girls were now sitting quietly on the steps.  Except, that one\nof them had pushed a drinking straw through a crack between the planks\nand was moving it slowly up and down.  \"You still don't seem to have\nmuch general idea of what the court's about\", said the painter, who had\nstretched his legs wide apart and was tapping loudly on the floor with\nthe tip of his foot. \"But as you're innocent you won't need it anyway.\nI'll get you out of this by myself.\"  \"How do you intend to do that?\"\nasked K.  \"You did say yourself not long ago that it's quite impossible\nto go to the court with reasons and proofs.\"  \"Only impossible for\nreasons and proofs you take to the court yourself\"  said the painter,\nraising his forefinger as if K. had failed to notice a fine distinction.\n\"It goes differently if you try to do something behind the public court,\nthat's to say in the consultation rooms, in the corridors or here, for\ninstance, in my studio.\"  K. now began to find it far easier to believe\nwhat the painter was saying, or rather it was largely in agreement with\nwhat he had also been told by others.  In fact it was even quite\npromising.  If it really was so easy to influence the judges through\npersonal contacts as the lawyer had said then the painter's contacts\nwith these vain judges was especially important, and at the very least\nshould not be undervalued.  And the painter would fit in very well in\nthe circle of assistants that K. was slowly gathering around himself.\nHe had been noted at the bank for his talent in organising, here, where\nhe was placed entirely on his own resources, would be a good opportunity\nto test that talent to its limits.  The painter observed the effect his\nexplanation had had on K. and then, with a certain unease, said, \"Does\nit not occur to you that the way I'm speaking is almost like a lawyer?\nIt's the incessant contact with the gentlemen of the court has that\ninfluence on me.  I gain a lot by it, of course, but I lose a lot,\nartistically speaking.\"   \"How did you first come into contact with the\njudges, then?\" asked K., he wanted first to gain the painter's trust\nbefore he took him into his service.  \"That was very easy,\" said the\npainter, \"I inherited these contacts.  My father was court painter\nbefore me.  It's a position that's always inherited.  They can't use new\npeople for it, the rules governing how the various grades of officials\nare painted are so many and varied, and, above all, so secret that no-\none outside of certain families even knows them.  In the drawer there,\nfor instance, I've got my father's notes, which I don't show to anyone.\nBut you're only able to paint judges if you know what they say.\nAlthough, even if I lost them no-one could ever dispute my position\nbecause of all the rules I just carry round in my head.  All the judges\nwant to be painted like the old, great judges were, and I'm the only one\nwho can do that.\"  \"You are to be envied,\" said K., thinking of his\nposition at the bank.  \"Your position is quite unassailable, then?\"\n\"Yes, quite unassailable,\" said the painter, and he raised his shoulders\nin pride. \"That's how I can even afford to help some poor man facing\ntrial now and then.\"  \"And how do you do that?\" asked K., as if the\npainter had not just described him as a poor man.  The painter did not\nlet himself be distracted, but said, \"In your case, for instance, as\nyou're totally innocent, this is what I'll do.\"  The repeated mention of\nK.'s innocence was becoming irksome to him.  It sometimes seemed to him\nas if the painter was using these comments to make a favourable outcome\nto the trial a precondition for his help, which of course would make the\nhelp itself unnecessary.  But despite these doubts K. forced himself not\nto interrupt the painter.  He did not want to do without the painter's\nhelp, that was what he had decided, and this help did not seem in any\nway less questionable than that of the lawyer.  K. valued the painter's\nhelp far more highly because it was offered in a way that was more\nharmless and open.\n\n        The painter had pulled his seat closer to the bed and continued in\na subdued voice: \"I forgot to ask you; what sort of acquittal is it you\nwant?  There are three possibilities; absolute acquittal, apparent\nacquittal and deferment.  Absolute acquittal is the best, of course,\nonly there's nothing I could do to get that sort of outcome.  I don't\nthink there's anyone at all who could do anything to get an absolute\nacquittal.  Probably the only thing that could do that is if the accused\nis innocent.  As you are innocent it could actually be possible and you\ncould depend on your innocence alone.  In that case you won't need me or\nany other kind of help.\"\n\n        At first, K. was astonished at this orderly explanation, but then,\njust as quietly as the painter, he said, \"I think you're contradicting\nyourself.\"  \"How's that?\" asked the painter patiently, leaning back with\na smile.  This smile made K. feel as if he were examining not the words\nof the painter but seeking out inconsistencies in the procedures of the\ncourt itself.  Nonetheless, he continued unabashed and said, \"You\nremarked earlier that the court cannot be approached with reasoned\nproofs, you later restricted this to the open court, and now you go so\nfar as to say that an innocent man needs no assistance in court.  That\nentails a contradiction.  Moreover, you said earlier that the judges can\nbe influenced personally but now you insist that an absolute acquittal,\nas you call it, can never be attained through personal influence.  That\nentails a second contradiction.\"  \"It's quite easy to clear up these\ncontradictions,\" said the painter.  \"We're talking about two different\nthings here, there's what it says in the law and there's what I know\nfrom my own experience, you shouldn't get the two confused.  I've never\nseen it in writing, but the law does, of course, say on the one hand\nthat the innocent will be set free, but on the other hand it doesn't say\nthat the judges can be influenced.  But in my experience it's the other\nway round.  I don't know of any absolute acquittals but I do know of\nmany times when a judge has been influenced.  It's possible, of course,\nthat there was no innocence in any of the cases I know about.  But is\nthat likely?  Not a single innocent defendant in so many cases?  When I\nwas a boy I used to listen closely to my father when he told us about\ncourt cases at home, and the judges that came to his studio talked about\nthe court, in our circles nobody talks about anything else; I hardly\never got the chance to go to court myself but always made use of it when\nI could, I've listened to countless trials at important stages in their\ndevelopment, I've followed them closely as far as they could be\nfollowed, and I have to say that I've never seen a single acquittal.\"\n\"So.  Not a single acquittal,\" said K., as if talking to himself and his\nhopes.  \"That confirms the impression I already have of the court.  So\nthere's no point in it from this side either.  They could replace the\nwhole court with a single hangman.\"  \"You shouldn't generalise,\" said\nthe painter, dissatisfied, \"I've only been talking about my own\nexperience.\"  \"Well that's enough,\" said K., \"or have you heard of any\nacquittals that happened earlier?\"  \"They say there have been some\nacquittals earlier,\" the painter answered, \"but it's very hard to be\nsure about it.  The courts don't make their final conclusions public,\nnot even the judges are allowed to know about them, so that all we know\nabout these earlier cases are just legends.  But most of them did\ninvolve absolute acquittals, you can believe that, but they can't be\nproved.  On the other hand, you shouldn't forget all about them either,\nI'm sure there is some truth to them, and they are very beautiful, I've\npainted a few pictures myself depicting these legends.\"  \"My assessment\nwill not be altered by mere legends,\" said K.  \"I don't suppose it's\npossible to cite these legends in court, is it?\"  The painter laughed.\n\"No, you can't cite them in court,\" he said.  \"Then there's no point in\ntalking about them,\" said K., he wanted, for the time being, to accept\nanything the painter told him, even if he thought it unlikely or\ncontradicted what he had been told by others.  He did not now have the\ntime to examine the truth of everything the painter said or even to\ndisprove it, he would have achieved as much as he could if the painter\nwould help him in any way even if his help would not be decisive.  As a\nresult, he said, \"So let's pay no more attention to absolute acquittal,\nbut you mentioned two other possibilities.\"  \"Apparent acquittal and\ndeferment.  They're the only possibilities,\" said the painter.  \"But\nbefore we talk about them, would you not like to take your coat off?\nYou must be hot.\"  \"Yes,\" said K., who until then had paid attention to\nnothing but the painter's explanations, but now that he had had the heat\npointed out to him his brow began to sweat heavily.  \"It's almost\nunbearable.\"  The painter nodded as if he understood K.'s discomfort\nvery well.  \"Could we not open the window?\" asked K.  \"No,\" said the\npainter.  \"It's only a fixed pane of glass, it can't be opened.\"  K. now\nrealised that all this time he had been hoping the painter would\nsuddenly go over to the window and pull it open.  He had prepared\nhimself even for the fog that he would breathe in through his open\nmouth.  The thought that here he was entirely cut off from the air made\nhim feel dizzy.  He tapped lightly on the bedspread beside him and, with\na weak voice, said, \"That is very inconvenient and unhealthy.\"  \"Oh no,\"\nsaid the painter in defence of his window, \"as it can't be opened this\nroom retains the heat better than if the window were double glazed, even\nthough it's only a single pane.  There's not much need to air the room\nas there's so much ventilation through the gaps in the wood, but when I\ndo want to I can open one of my doors, or even both of them.\"  K. was\nslightly consoled by this explanation and looked around to see where the\nsecond door was.  The painter saw him do so and said, \"It's behind you,\nI had to hide it behind the bed.\"  Only then was K. able to see the\nlittle door in the wall.  \"It's really much too small for a studio\nhere,\" said the painter, as if he wanted to anticipate an objection K.\nwould make.  \"I had to arrange things as well as I could.  That's\nobviously a very bad place for the bed, in front of the door.  For\ninstance when the judge I'm painting at present comes he always comes\nthrough the door by the bed, and I've even given him a key to this door\nso that he can wait for me here in the studio when I'm not home.\nAlthough nowadays he usually comes early in the morning when I'm still\nasleep.  And of course, it always wakes me up when I hear the door\nopened beside the bed, however fast asleep I am.  If you could hear the\nway I curse him as he climbs over my bed in the morning you'd lose all\nrespect for judges.  I suppose I could take the key away from him but\nthat'd only make things worse.  It only takes a tiny effort to break any\nof the doors here off their hinges.\"  All the time the painter was\nspeaking, K. was considering whether he should take off his coat, but he\nfinally realised that, if he didn't do so, he would be quite unable to\nstay here any longer, so he took off his frock coat and lay it on his\nknee so that he could put it back on again as soon as the conversation\nwas over.  He had hardly done this when one of the girls called out,\n\"Now he's taken his coat off!\" and they could all be heard pressing\naround the gaps in the planks to see the spectacle for themselves.  \"The\ngirls think I'm going to paint your portrait,\" said the painter, \"and\nthat's why you're taking your coat off.\"  \"I see,\" said K., only\nslightly amused by this, as he felt little better than he had before\neven though he now sat in his shirtsleeves.  With some irritation he\nasked, \"What did you say the two other possibilities were?\"  He had\nalready forgotten the terms used.  \"Apparent acquittal and deferment,\"\nsaid the painter.  \"It's up to you which one you choose.  You can get\neither of them if I help you, but it'll take some effort of course, the\ndifference between them is that apparent acquittal needs concentrated\neffort for a while and that deferment takes much less effort but it has\nto be sustained.  Now then, apparent acquittal.  If that's what you want\nI'll write down an assertion of your innocence on a piece of paper.  The\ntext for an assertion of this sort was passed down to me from my father\nand it's quite unassailable.  I take this assertion round to the judges\nI know.  So I'll start off with the one I'm currently painting, and put\nthe assertion to him when he comes for his sitting this evening.  I'll\nlay the assertion in front of him, explain that you're innocent and give\nhim my personal guarantee of it.  And that's not just a superficial\nguarantee, it's a real one and it's binding.\"  The painter's eyes seemed\nto show some reproach of K. for wanting to impose that sort of\nresponsibility on him.  \"That would be very kind of you\", said K.  \"And\nwould the judge then believe you and nonetheless not pass an absolute\nacquittal?\"  \"It's like I just said,\" answered the painter.  \"And\nanyway, it's not entirely sure that all the judges would believe me,\nmany of them, for instance, might want me to bring you to see them\npersonally.  So then you'd have to come along too.  But at least then,\nif that happens, the matter is half way won, especially as I'd teach you\nin advance exactly how you'd need to act with the judge concerned, of\ncourse.  What also happens, though, is that there are some judges who'll\nturn me down in advance, and that's worse.  I'll certainly make several\nattempts, but still, we'll have to forget about them, but at least we\ncan afford to do that as no one judge can pass the decisive verdict.\nThen when I've got enough judges' signatures on this document I take it\nto the judge who's concerned with your case.  I might even have his\nsignature already, in which case things develop a bit quicker than they\nwould do otherwise.  But there aren't usually many hold ups from then\non, and that's the time that the defendant can feel most confident.\nIt's odd, but true, that people feel more confidence in this time than\nthey do after they've been acquitted.  There's no particular exertion\nneeded now.  When he has the document asserting the defendant's\ninnocence, guaranteed by a number of other judges, the judge can acquit\nyou without any worries, and although there are still several\nformalities to be gone through there's no doubt that that's what he'll\ndo as a favour to me and several other acquaintances.  You, however,\nwalk out the court and you're free.\"  \"So, then I'll be free,\" said K.,\nhesitantly.  \"That's right,\" said the painter, \"but only apparently free\nor, to put it a better way, temporarily free, as the most junior judges,\nthe ones I know, they don't have the right to give the final acquittal.\nOnly the highest judge can do that, in the court that's quite out of reach\nfor you, for me and for all of us.  We don't know how things look there\nand, incidentally, we don't want to know.   The right to acquit people\nis a major privilege and our judges don't have it, but they do have the\nright to free people from the indictment.  That's to say, if they're\nfreed in this way then for the time being the charge is withdrawn but\nit's still hanging over their heads and it only takes an order from\nhigher up to bring it back into force.  And as I'm in such good contact\nwith the court I can also tell you how the difference between absolute\nand apparent acquittal is described, just in a superficial way, in the\ndirectives to the court offices.  If there's an absolute acquittal all\nproceedings should stop, everything disappears from the process, not\njust the indictment but the trial and even the acquittal disappears,\neverything just disappears.  With an apparent acquittal it's different.\nWhen that happens, nothing has changed except that the case for your\ninnocence, for your acquittal and the grounds for the acquittal have\nbeen made stronger.  Apart from that, proceedings go on as before, the\ncourt offices continue their business and the case gets passed to higher\ncourts, gets passed back down to the lower courts and so on, backwards\nand forwards, sometimes faster, sometimes slower, to and fro.  It's\nimpossible to know exactly what's happening while this is going on.\nSeen from outside it can sometimes seem that everything has been long\nsince forgotten, the documents have been lost and the acquittal is\ncomplete.  No-one familiar with the court would believe it.  No\ndocuments ever get lost, the court forgets nothing.   One day - no-one\nexpects it - some judge or other picks up the documents and looks more\nclosely at them, he notices that this particular case is still active,\nand orders the defendant's immediate arrest.  I've been talking here as\nif there's a long delay between apparent acquittal and re-arrest, that\nis quite possible and I do know of cases like that, but it's just as\nlikely that the defendant goes home after he's been acquitted and finds\nsomebody there waiting to re-arrest him.  Then, of course, his life as a\nfree man is at an end.\"  \"And does the trial start over again?\" asked\nK., finding it hard to believe.  \"The trial will always start over\nagain,\" said the painter, \"but there is, once again as before, the\npossibility of getting an apparent acquittal.  Once again, the accused\nhas to muster all his strength and mustn't give up.\"  The painter said\nthat last phrase possibly as a result of the impression that K., whose\nshoulders had dropped somewhat, gave on him.  \"But to get a second\nacquittal,\" asked K., as if in anticipation of further revelations by\nthe painter, \"is that not harder to get than the first time?\"  \"As far\nas that's concerned,\" answered the painter, \"there's nothing you can say\nfor certain.  You mean, do you, that the second arrest would have an\nadverse influence on the judge and the verdict he passes on the\ndefendant?  That's not how it happens.  When the acquittal is passed the\njudges are already aware that re-arrest is likely.  So when it happens\nit has hardly any effect.  But there are countless other reasons why the\njudges' mood and their legal acumen in the case can be altered, and\nefforts to obtain the second acquittal must therefore be suited to the\nnew conditions, and generally just as vigorous as the first.\"  \"But this\nsecond acquittal will once again not be final,\" said K., shaking his\nhead.  \"Of course not,\" said the painter, \"the second acquittal is\nfollowed by the third arrest, the third acquittal by the fourth arrest\nand so on.  That's what is meant by the term apparent acquittal.\"  K.\nwas silent.  \"You clearly don't think an apparent acquittal offers much\nadvantage,\" said the painter, \"perhaps deferment would suit you better.\nWould you like me to explain what deferment is about?\"  K. nodded.  The\npainter had leant back and spread himself out in his chair, his\nnightshirt was wide open, he had pushed his hand inside and was stroking\nhis breast and his sides.  \"Deferment,\" said the painter, looking\nvaguely in front of himself for a while as if trying to find a perfectly\nappropriate explanation, \"deferment consists of keeping proceedings\npermanently in their earliest stages.  To do that, the accused and those\nhelping him need to keep in continuous personal contact with the court,\nespecially those helping him.  I repeat, this doesn't require so much\neffort as getting an apparent acquittal, but it probably requires a lot\nmore attention.  You must never let the trial out of your sight, you\nhave to go and see the appropriate judge at regular intervals as well as\nwhen something in particular comes up and, whatever you do, you have to\ntry and remain friendly with him; if you don't know the judge personally\nyou have to influence him through the judges you do know, and you have\nto do it without giving up on the direct discussions.  As long as you\ndon't fail to do any of these things you can be reasonably sure the\ntrial won't get past its first stages.  The trial doesn't stop, but the\ndefendant is almost as certain of avoiding conviction as if he'd been\nacquitted.  Compared with an apparent acquittal, deferment has the\nadvantage that the defendant's future is less uncertain, he's safe from\nthe shock of being suddenly re-arrested and doesn't need to fear the\nexertions and stress involved in getting an apparent acquittal just when\neverything else in his life would make it most difficult.  Deferment\ndoes have certain disadvantages of its own though, too, and they\nshouldn't be under-estimated.  I don't mean by this that the defendant\nis never free, he's never free in the proper sense of the word with an\napparent acquittal either.  There's another disadvantage.  Proceedings\ncan't be prevented from moving forward unless there are some at least\nostensible reasons given.  So something needs to seem to be happening\nwhen looked at from the outside.  This means that from time to time\nvarious injunctions have to be obeyed, the accused has to be questioned,\ninvestigations have to take place and so on.  The trial's been\nartificially constrained inside a tiny circle, and it has to be\ncontinuously spun round within it.  And that, of course, brings with it\ncertain unpleasantnesses for the accused, although you shouldn't imagine\nthey're all that bad.  All of this is just for show, the interrogations,\nfor instance, they're only very short, if you ever don't have the time\nor don't feel like going to them you can offer an excuse, with some\njudges you can even arrange the injunctions together a long time in\nadvance, in essence all it means is that, as the accused, you have to\nreport to the judge from time to time.\"  Even while the painter was\nspeaking those last words K. had laid his coat over his arm and had\nstood up.  Immediately, from outside the door, there was a cry of  'He's\nstanding up now!'.  \"Are you leaving already?\" asked the painter, who\nhad also stood up.  \"It must be the air that's driving you out.  I'm\nvery sorry about that.  There's still a lot I need to tell you.  I had\nto put everything very briefly but I hope at least it was all clear.\"\n\"Oh yes,\" said K., whose head was aching from the effort of listening.\nDespite this affirmation the painter summed it all up once more, as if\nhe wanted to give K. something to console him on his way home.  \"Both\nhave in common that they prevent the defendant being convicted,\" he\nsaid.  \"But they also prevent his being properly acquitted,\" said K.\nquietly, as if ashamed to acknowledge it. \"You've got it, in essence,\"\nsaid the painter quickly.  K. placed his hand on his winter overcoat but\ncould not bring himself to put it on.  Most of all he would have liked\nto pack everything together and run out to the fresh air.  Not even the\ngirls could induce him to put his coat on, even though they were already\nloudly telling each other that he was doing so.  The painter still had\nto interpret K.'s mood in some way, so he said, \"I expect you've\ndeliberately avoided deciding between my suggestions yet.  That's good.\nI would even have advised against making a decision straight away.\nThere's no more than a hair's breadth of difference between the\nadvantages and disadvantages.  Everything has to be carefully weighed\nup.  But the most important thing is you shouldn't lose too much time.\"\n\"I'll come back here again soon,\" said K., who had suddenly decided to\nput his frock coat on, threw his overcoat over his shoulder and hurried\nover to the door behind which the girls now began to scream.  K. thought\nhe could even see the screaming girls through the door.  \"Well, you'll\nhave to keep your word,\" said the painter, who had not followed him,\n\"otherwise I'll come to the bank to ask about it myself.\"  \"Will you open\nthis door for me,\" said K. pulling at the handle which, as he noticed\nfrom the resistance, was being held tightly by the girls on the other\nside.  \"Do you want to be bothered by the girls?\" asked the painter.\n\"It's better if you use the other way out,\" he said, pointing to the\ndoor behind the bed.  K. agreed to this and jumped back to the bed.  But\ninstead of opening that door the painter crawled under the bed and from\nunderneath it asked K., \"Just a moment more, would you not like to see a\npicture I could sell to you?\"  K. did not want to be impolite, the\npainter really had taken his side and promised to help him more in the\nfuture, and because of K.'s forgetfulness there had been no mention of\nany payment for the painter's help, so K. could not turn him down now\nand allowed him to show him the picture, even though he was quivering\nwith impatience to get out of the studio.  From under the bed, the\npainter withdrew a pile of unframed paintings.  They were so covered in\ndust that when the painter tried to blow it off the one on top the dust\nswirled around in front of K.'s eyes, robbing him of breath for some\ntime.  \"Moorland landscape,\" said the painter passing the picture to K.\nIt showed two sickly trees, well separated from each other in dark\ngrass.  In the background there was a multi-coloured sunset.  \"That's\nnice,\" said K.  \"I'll buy it.\"  K. expressed himself in this curt way\nwithout any thought, so he was glad when the painter did not take this\namiss and picked up a second painting from the floor.  \"This is a\ncounterpart to the first picture,\" said the painter.  Perhaps it had\nbeen intended as a counterpart, but there was not the slightest\ndifference to be seen between it and the first picture, there were the\ntrees, there the grass and there the sunset.  But this was of little\nimportance to K.  \"They are beautiful landscapes,\" he said, \"I'll buy\nthem both and hang them in my office.\"  \"You seem to like this subject,\"\nsaid the painter, picking up a third painting, \"good job I've still got\nanother, similar picture here.\"  The picture though, was not similar,\nrather it was exactly the same moorland landscape.  The painter was\nfully exploiting this opportunity to sell off his old pictures.  \"I'll\ntake this one too,\" said K.  \"How much do the three paintings cost?\"\n\"We can talk about that next time,\" said the painter.  \"You're in a\nhurry now, and we'll still be in contact.  And besides, I'm glad you\nlike the paintings, I'll give you all the paintings I've got down here.\nThey're all moorland landscapes, I've painted a lot of moorland\nlandscapes.  A lot of people don't like that sort of picture because\nthey're too gloomy, but there are others, and you're one of them, who\nlove gloomy themes.\"  But K. was not in the mood to hear about the\nprofessional experiences of this painter cum beggar.  \"Wrap them all\nup!\" he called out, interrupting the painter as he was speaking, \"my\nservant will come to fetch them in the morning.\"  \"There's no need for\nthat,\" said the painter.  \"I expect I can find a porter for you who can\ngo with you now.\"  And, at last, he leant over the bed and unlocked the\ndoor.  \"Just step on the bed, don't worry about that,\" said the painter,\n\"that's what everyone does who comes in here.\"  Even without this\ninvitation, K. had shown no compunction in already placing his foot in\nthe middle of the bed covers, then he looked out through the open door\nand drew his foot back again.  \"What is that?\" he asked the painter.\n\"What are you so surprised at?\" he asked, surprised in his turn.  \"Those\nare court offices.  Didn't you know there are court offices here?  There\nare court offices in almost every attic, why should this building be any\ndifferent?  Even my studio is actually one of the court offices but the\ncourt put it at my disposal.\"  It was not so much finding court offices\neven here that shocked K., he was mainly shocked at himself, at his own\nnaivety in court matters.  It seemed to him that one of the most basic\nrules governing how a defendant should behave was always to be prepared,\nnever allow surprises, never to look, unsuspecting, to the right when\nthe judge stood beside him to his left - and this was the very basic\nrule that he was continually violating.  A long corridor extended in\nfrom of him, air blew in from it which, compared with the air in the\nstudio, was refreshing.  There were benches set along each side of the\ncorridor just as in the waiting area for the office he went to himself.\nThere seemed to be precise rules governing how offices should be\nequipped.   There did not seem to be many people visiting the offices\nthat day.  There was a man there, half sitting, half laying, his face\nwas buried in his arm on the bench and he seemed to be sleeping; another\nman was standing in the half-dark at the end of the corridor.  K. now\nclimbed over the bed, the painter followed him with the pictures.  They\nsoon came across a servant of the court - K. was now able to recognise\nall the servants of the court from the gold buttons they wore on their\ncivilian clothes below the normal buttons - and the painter instructed\nhim to go with K. carrying the pictures.  K. staggered more than he\nwalked, his handkerchief pressed over his mouth.  They had nearly\nreached the exit when the girls stormed in on them, so K. had not been\nable to avoid them.  They had clearly seen that the second door of the\nstudio had been opened and had gone around to impose themselves on him\nfrom this side.  \"I can't come with you any further!\" called out the\npainter with a laugh as the girls pressed in.  \"Goodbye, and don't\nhesitate too long!\"  K. did not even look round at him.  Once on the\nstreet he took the first cab he came across.  He now had to get rid of\nthe servant, whose gold button continually caught his eye even if it\ncaught no-one else's.  As a servant, the servant of the court was going\nto sit on the coach-box.  But K. chased him down from there.  It was\nalready well into the afternoon when K. arrived in front of the bank.\nHe would have liked to leave the pictures in the cab but feared there\nmight be some occasion when he would have to let the painter see he\nstill had them.  So he had the pictures taken to his office and locked\nthem in the lowest drawer of his desk so that he could at least keep\nthem safe from the deputy director's view for the next few days.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Eight\n Block, the businessman  - Dismissing the lawyer\n\n        K. had at last made the decision to withdraw his defence from the\nlawyer.   It was impossible to remove his doubts as to whether this was\nthe right decision, but this was outweighed by his belief in its\nnecessity.  This decision, on the day he intended to go to see the\nlawyer, took a lot of the strength he needed for his work, he worked\nexceptionally slowly, he had to remain in his office a long time, and it\nwas already past ten o'clock when he finally stood in front of the\nlawyer's front door.  Even before he rang he considered whether it might\nnot be better to give the lawyer notice by letter or telephone, a\npersonal conversation would certainly be very difficult.  Nonetheless,\nK. did not actually want to do without it, if he gave notice by any\nother means it would be received in silence or with a few formulated\nwords, and unless Leni could discover anything K. would never learn how\nthe lawyer had taken his dismissal and what its consequences might be,\nin the lawyer's not unimportant opinion.  But sitting in front of him\nand taken by surprise by his dismissal, K. would be able easily to infer\neverything he wanted from the lawyer's face and behaviour, even if he\ncould not be induced to say very much.  It was not even out of the\nquestion that K. might, after all, be persuaded that it would be best to\nleave his defence to the lawyer and withdraw his dismissal.\n\n        As usual, there was at first no response to K.'s ring at the door.\n\"Leni could be a bit quicker,\" thought K.  But he could at least be glad\nthere was nobody else interfering as usually happened, be it the man in\nhis nightshirt or anyone else who might bother him.  As K. pressed on\nthe button for the second time he looked back at the other door, but\nthis time it, too, remained closed.  At last, two eyes appeared at the\nspy-hatch in the lawyer's door, although they weren't Leni's eyes.\nSomeone unlocked the door, but kept himself pressed against it as he\ncalled back inside, \"It's him!\", and only then did he open the door\nproperly.  K. pushed against the door, as behind him he could already\nhear the key being hurriedly turned in the lock of the door to the other\nflat.  When the door in front of him finally opened, he stormed straight\ninto the hallway.  Through the corridor which led between the rooms he\nsaw Leni, to whom the warning cry of the door opener had been directed,\nstill running away in her nightshirt.  He looked at her for a moment\nand then looked round at the person who had opened the door.  It was a\nsmall, wizened man with a full beard, he held a candle in his hand.  \"Do\nyou work here?\" asked K.  \"No,\" answered the man, \"I don't belong here\nat all, the lawyer is only representing me, I'm here on legal business.\"\n\"Without your coat?\" asked K., indicating the man's deficiency of dress\nwith a gesture of his hand.  \"Oh, do forgive me!\" said the man, and he\nlooked at himself in the light of the candle he was holding as if he had\nnot known about his appearance until then.\n\"Is Leni your lover?\" asked K. curtly.  He had set his legs slightly\napart, his hands, in which he held his hat, were behind his back.\nMerely by being in possession of a thick overcoat he felt his advantage\nover this thin little man.  \"Oh God,\" he said and, shocked, raised one\nhand in front of his face as if in defence, \"no, no, what can you be\nthinking?\"  \"You look honest enough,\" said K. with a smile, \"but come\nalong anyway.\"  K. indicated with his hat which way the man was to go\nand let him go ahead of him.  \"What is your name then?\" asked K. on the\nway.  \"Block.  I'm a businessman,\" said the small man, twisting himself\nround as he thus introduced himself, although K. did not allow him to\nstop moving.  \"Is that your real name?\" asked K.  \"Of course it is,\" was\nthe man's reply, \"why do you doubt it?\"  \"I thought you might have some\nreason to keep your name secret,\" said K.  He felt himself as much at\nliberty as is normally only felt in foreign parts when speaking with\npeople of lower standing, keeping everything about himself to himself,\nspeaking only casually about the interests of the other, able to raise\nhim to a level above one's own, but also able, at will, to let him drop\nagain.  K. stopped at the door of the lawyer's office, opened it and, to\nthe businessman who had obediently gone ahead, called, \"Not so fast!\nBring some light here!\"  K. thought Leni might have hidden in here, he\nlet the businessman search in every corner, but the room was empty.  In\nfront of the picture of the judge K. took hold of the businessman's\nbraces to stop him moving on.  \"Do you know him?\" he asked, pointing\nupwards with his finger.  The businessman lifted the candle, blinked as\nhe looked up and said, \"It's a judge.\"  \"An important judge?\" asked K.,\nand stood to the side and in front of the businessman so that he could\nobserve what impression the picture had on him.  The businessman was\nlooking up in admiration.  \"He's an important judge.\"  \"You don't have\nmuch insight,\" said K.  \"He is the lowest of the lowest examining\njudges.\"  \"I remember now,\" said the businessman as he lowered the\ncandle, \"that's what I've already been told.\"  \"Well of course you\nhave,\" called out K., \"I'd forgotten about it, of course you would\nalready have been told.\"  \"But why, why?\" asked the businessman as he\nmoved forwards towards the door, propelled by the hands of K.  Outside\nin the corridor K. said,\n\"You know where Leni's hidden, do you?\"  \"Hidden?\" said the businessman,\n\"No, but she might be in the kitchen cooking soup for the lawyer.\"  \"Why\ndidn't you say that immediately?\" asked K.  \"I was going to take you\nthere, but you called me back again,\" answered the businessman, as if\nconfused by the contradictory commands.  \"You think you're very clever,\ndon't you,\" said K, \"now take me there!\"  K. had never been in the\nkitchen, it was surprisingly big and very well equipped.  The stove\nalone was three times bigger than normal stoves, but it was not possible\nto see any detail beyond this as the kitchen was at the time illuminated\nby no more than a small lamp hanging by the entrance.  At the stove\nstood Leni, in a white apron as always, breaking eggs into a pot\nstanding on a spirit lamp.\n\"Good evening, Josef,\" she said with a glance sideways.  \"Good evening,\"\nsaid K., pointing with one hand to a chair in a corner which the\nbusinessman was to sit on, and he did indeed sit down on it.  K. however\nwent very close behind Leni's back, leant over her shoulder and asked,\n\"Who is this man?\"  Leni put one hand around K. as she stirred the soup\nwith the other, she drew him forward toward herself and said, \"He's a\npitiful character, a poor businessman by the name of Block.  Just look\nat him.\"  The two of them looked back over their shoulders.  The\nbusinessman was sitting on the chair that K. had directed him to, he had\nextinguished the candle whose light was no longer needed and pressed on\nthe wick with his fingers to stop the smoke.  \"You were in your\nnightshirt,\" said K., putting his hand on her head and turning it back\ntowards the stove.  She was silent.  \"Is he your lover?\" asked K.  She\nwas about to take hold of the pot of soup, but K. took both her hands\nand said, \"Answer me!\"  She said, \"Come into the office, I'll explain\neverything to you.\"  \"No,\" said K., \"I want you to explain it here.\"\nShe put her arms around him and wanted to kiss him.  K., though, pushed\nher away and said, \"I don't want you to kiss me now.\"  \"Josef,\" said\nLeni, looking at K. imploringly but frankly in the eyes, \"you're not\ngoing to be jealous of Mr. Block now, are you?  Rudi,\" she then said,\nturning to the businessman, \"help me out will you, I'm being suspected\nof something, you can see that, leave the candle alone.\"  It had looked\nas though Mr. Block had not been paying attention but he had been\nfollowing closely.  \"I don't even know why you might be jealous,\" he\nsaid ingenuously.  \"Nor do I, actually,\" said K., looking at the\nbusinessman with a smile.  Leni laughed out loud and while K. was not\npaying attention took the opportunity of embracing him and whispering,\n\"Leave him alone, now, you can see what sort of person he is.  I've been\nhelping him a little bit because he's an important client of the\nlawyer's, and no other reason.  And what about you?  Do you want to\nspeak to the lawyer at this time of day?  He's very unwell today, but if\nyou want I'll tell him you're here.  But you can certainly spend the\nnight with me.  It's so long since you were last here, even the lawyer\nhas been asking about you.  Don't neglect your case!  And I've got some\nthings to tell you that I've learned about.  But now, before anything\nelse, take your coat off!\"  She helped him off with his coat, took the\nhat off his head, ran with the things into the hallway to hang them up,\nthen she ran back and saw to the soup.  \"Do you want me to tell him\nyou're here straight away or take him his soup first?\"  \"Tell him I'm\nhere first,\" said K.  He was in a bad mood, he had originally intended a\ndetailed discussion of his business with Leni, especially the question\nof his giving the lawyer notice, but now he no longer wanted to because\nof the presence of the businessman.  Now he considered his affair too\nimportant to let this little businessman take part in it and perhaps\nchange some of his decisions, and so\nhe called Leni back even though she was already on her way to the\nlawyer.  \"Bring him his soup first,\" he said, \"I want him to get his\nstrength up for the discussion with me, he'll need it.\"  \"You're a\nclient of the lawyer's too, aren't you,\" said the businessman quietly\nfrom his corner as if he were trying to find this out.  It was not,\nhowever, taken well.  \"What business is that of yours?\" said K., and\nLeni said,\n\"Will you be quiet. - I'll take him his soup first then, shall I?\" And\nshe poured the soup into a dish. \"The only worry then is that he might\ngo to sleep soon after he's eaten.\"  \"What I've got to say to him will\nkeep him awake,\" said K., who still wanted to intimate that he intended\nsome important negotiations with the lawyer, he wanted Leni to ask him\nwhat it was and only then to ask her advice.  But instead, she just\npromptly carried out the order he had given her.  When she went over to\nhim with the dish she deliberately brushed against him and whispered,\n\"I'll tell him you're here as soon as he's eaten the soup so that I can\nget you back as soon as possible.\"  \"Just go,\" said K., \"just go.\"  \"Be\na bit more friendly,\" she said and, still holding the dish, turned\ncompletely round once more in the doorway.\n\n        K. watched her as she went; the decision had finally been made\nthat the lawyer was to be dismissed, it was probably better that he had\nnot been able to discuss the matter any more with Leni beforehand; she\nhardly understood the complexity of the matter, she would certainly have\nadvised him against it and perhaps would even have prevented him from\ndismissing the lawyer this time, he would have remained in doubt and\nunease and eventually have carried out his decision after a while anyway\nas this decision was something he could not avoid.  The sooner it was\ncarried out the more harm would be avoided.  And moreover, perhaps the\nbusinessman had something to say on the matter.\n\n        K. turned round, the businessman hardly noticed it as he was about\nto stand up.  \"Stay where you are,\" said K. and pulled up a chair beside\nhim.  \"Have you been a client of the lawyer's for a long time?\" asked K.\n\"Yes,\" said the businessman, \"a very long time.\"  \"How many years has he\nbeen representing you so far, then?\" asked K.  \"I don't know how you\nmean,\" said the businessman, \"he's been my business lawyer - I buy and\nsell cereals - he's been my business lawyer since I took the business\nover, and that's about twenty years now, but perhaps you mean my own\ntrial and he's been representing me in that since it started, and that's\nbeen more than five years.  Yes, well over five years,\" he then added,\npulling out an old briefcase, \"I've got everything written down; I can\ntell you the exact dates if you like.  It's so hard to remember\neverything.  Probably, my trial's been going on much longer than that,\nit started soon after the death of my wife, and that's been more than\nfive and a half years now.\"  K. moved in closer to him.  \"So the lawyer\ntakes on ordinary legal business, does he?\" he asked.  This combination\nof criminal and commercial business seemed surprisingly reassuring for\nK.  \"Oh yes,\" said the businessman, and then he whispered,  \"They even\nsay he's more efficient in jurisprudence than he is in other matters.\"\nBut then he seemed to regret saying this, and he laid a hand on K.'s\nshoulder and said, \"Please don't betray me to him, will you.\"  K. patted\nhis thigh to reassure him and said, \"No, I don't betray people.\"  \"He\ncan be so vindictive, you see,\" said the businessman.\n\"I'm sure he won't do anything against such a faithful client as you,\"\nsaid K.  \"Oh, he might do,\" said the businessman, \"when he gets cross it\ndoesn't matter who it is, and anyway, I'm not really faithful to him.\"\n\"How's that then?\" asked K.  \"I'm not sure I should tell you about it,\"\nsaid the businessman hesitantly.  \"I think it'll be alright,\" said K.\n\"Well then,\" said the businessman, \"I'll tell you about some of it, but\nyou'll have to tell me a secret too, then we can support each other with\nthe lawyer.\"  \"You are very careful,\" said K., \"but I'll tell you a\nsecret that will set your mind completely at ease.  Now tell me, in what\nway have you been unfaithful to the lawyer?\"  \"I've ...\" said the\nbusinessman hesitantly, and in a tone as if he were confessing something\ndishonourable, \"I've taken on other lawyers besides him.\"  \"That's not\nso serious,\" said K., a little disappointed.  \"It is, here,\" said the\nbusinessman, who had had some difficulty breathing since making his\nconfession but who now, after hearing K.'s comment, began to feel more\ntrust for him.  \"That's not allowed.  And it's allowed least of all to\ntake on petty lawyers when you've already got a proper one.  And that's\njust what I have done, besides him I've got five petty lawyers.\"\n\"Five!\" exclaimed K., astonished at this number, \"Five lawyers besides\nthis one?\"  The businessman nodded.  \"I'm even negotiating with a sixth\none.\"  \"But why do you need so many lawyers?\" asked K.  \"I need all of\nthem,\" said the businessman.  \"Would you mind explaining that to me?\"\nasked K.  \"I'd be glad to,\" said the businessman.  \"Most of all, I don't\nwant to lose my case, well that's obvious.  So that means I mustn't\nneglect anything that might be of use to me; even if there's very little\nhope of a particular thing being of any use I can't just throw it away.\nSo everything I have I've put to use in my case.  I've taken all the\nmoney out of my business, for example, the offices for my business used\nto occupy nearly a whole floor, but now all I need is a little room at\nthe back where I work with one apprentice.  It wasn't just using up the\nmoney that caused the difficulty, of course, it was much more to do with\nme not working at the business as much as I used to.  If you want to do\nsomething about your trial you don't have much time for anything else.\"\n\"So you're also working at the court yourself?\" asked K.  \"That's just\nwhat I want to learn more about.\"  \"I can't tell you very much about\nthat,\" said the businessman, \"at first I tried to do that too but I soon\nhad to give it up again.  It wears you out too much, and it's really not\nmuch use.  And it turned out to be quite impossible to work there\nyourself and to negotiate, at least for me it was.  It's a heavy strain\nthere just sitting and waiting.  You know yourself what the air is like\nin those offices.\"  \"How do you know I've been there, then?\" asked K.\n\"I was in the waiting room myself when you went through.\"  \"What a\ncoincidence that is!\" exclaimed K., totally engrossed and forgetting how\nridiculous the businessman had seemed to him earlier.  \"So you saw me!\nYou were in the waiting room when I went through.  Yes, I did go through\nit one time.\"  \"It isn't such a big coincidence,\" said the businessman,\n\"I'm there nearly every day.\"  \"I expect I'll have to go there quite\noften myself now,\" said K., \"although I can hardly expect to be shown\nthe same respect as I was then.  They all stood up for me.  They must\nhave thought I was a judge.\"  \"No,\" said the businessman, \"we were\ngreeting the servant of the court.  We knew you were a defendant.  That\nsort of news spreads very quickly.\"  \"So you already knew about that,\"\nsaid K., \"the way I behaved must have seemed very arrogant to you.  Did\nyou criticise me for it afterwards?\"  \"No,\" said the businessman, \"quite\nthe opposite.  That was just stupidity.\"  \"What do you mean,\n'stupidity'?\" asked K.  \"Why are you asking about it?\" said the\nbusinessman in some irritation.  \"You still don't seem to know the\npeople there and you might take it wrong.  Don't forget in proceedings\nlike this there are always lots of different things coming up to talk\nabout, things that you just can't understand with reason alone, you just\nget too tired and distracted for most things and so, instead, people\nrely on superstition.  I'm talking about the others, but I'm no better\nmyself.  One of these superstitions, for example, is that you can learn\na lot about the outcome of a defendant's case by looking at his face,\nespecially the shape of his lips.  There are lots who believe that, and\nthey said they could see from the shape of your lips that you'd\ndefinitely be found guilty very soon.  I repeat that all this is just a\nridiculous superstition, and in most cases it's completely disproved by\nthe facts, but when you live in that society it's hard to hold yourself\nback from beliefs like that.  Just think how much effect that\nsuperstition can have.  You spoke to one of them there, didn't you?  He\nwas hardly able to give you an answer.  There are lots of things there\nthat can make you confused, of course, but one of them, for him, was the\nappearance of your lips.  He told us all later he thought he could see\nsomething in your lips that meant he'd be convicted himself.\"  \"On my\nlips?\" asked K., pulling out a pocket mirror and examining himself.  \"I\ncan see nothing special about my lips.  Can you?\"  \"Nor can I,\" said the\nbusinessman, \"nothing at all.\"  \"These people are so superstitious!\"\nexclaimed K.  \"Isn't that what I just told you?\" asked the businessman.\n\"Do you then have that much contact with each other, exchanging each\nother's opinions?\" said K.  \"I've kept myself completely apart so far.\"\n\"They don't normally have much contact with each other,\" said the\nbusinessman, \"that would be impossible, there are so many of them.  And\nthey don't have much in common either.  If a group of them ever thinks\nthey have found something in common it soon turns out they were\nmistaken.  There's nothing you can do as a group where the court's\nconcerned.  Each case is examined separately, the court is very\npainstaking.  So there's nothing to be achieved by forming into a group,\nonly sometimes an individual will achieve something in secret; and it's\nonly when that's been done the others learn about it; nobody knows how\nit was done.  So there's no sense of togetherness, you meet people now\nand then in the waiting rooms, but we don't talk much there.  The\nsuperstitious beliefs were established a long time ago and they spread\nall by themselves.\"  \"I saw those gentlemen in the waiting room,\" said\nK., \"it seemed so pointless for them to be waiting in that way.\"\n\"Waiting is not pointless,\" said the businessman, \"it's only pointless\nif you try and interfere yourself.  I told you just now I've got five\nlawyers besides this one.  You might think - I thought it myself at\nfirst - you might think I could leave the whole thing entirely up to\nthem now.  That would be entirely wrong.  I can leave it up to them less\nthan when I had just the one.  Maybe you don't understand that, do you?\"\n\"No,\" said K., and to slow the businessman down, who had been speaking\ntoo fast, he laid his hand on the businessman's to reassure him, \"but\nI'd like just to ask you to speak a little more slowly, these are many\nvery important things for me, and I can't follow exactly what you're\nsaying.\"  \"You're quite right to remind me of that,\" said the\nbusinessman, \"you're new to all this, a junior.  Your trial is six\nmonths old, isn't it?  Yes, I've heard about it.  Such a new case!  But\nI've already thought all these things through countless times, to me\nthey're the most obvious things in the world.\"  \"You must be glad your\ntrial has already progressed so far, are you?\" asked K., he did not wish\nto ask directly how the businessman's affairs stood, but received no\nclear answer anyway.  \"Yes, I've been working at my trial for five years\nnow,\" said the businessman as his head sank, \"that's no small\nachievement.\"  Then he was silent for a while.  K. listened to hear\nwhether Leni was on her way back.  On the one hand he did not want her\nto come back too soon as he still had many questions to ask and did not\nwant her to find him in this intimate discussion with the businessman,\nbut on the other hand it irritated him that she stayed so long with the\nlawyer when K. was there, much longer than she needed to give him his\nsoup.  \"I still remember it exactly,\" the businessman began again, and\nK. immediately gave him his full attention, \"when my case was as old as\nyours is now.  I only had this one lawyer at that time but I wasn't very\nsatisfied with him.\"  Now I'll find out everything, thought K., nodding\nvigorously as if he could thereby encourage the businessman to say\neverything worth knowing.  \"My case,\" the businessman continued, \"didn't\nmove on at all, there were some hearings that took place and I went to\nevery one of them, collected materials, handed all my business books to\nthe court - which I later found was entirely  unnecessary - I ran back\nand forth to the lawyer, and he submitted various documents to the court\ntoo ...\"  \"Various documents?\" asked K.  \"Yes, that's right,\" said the\nbusinessman.  \"That's very important for me,\" said K., \"in my case he's\nstill working on the first set of documents.  He still hasn't done\nanything.  I see now that he's been neglecting me quite disgracefully.\"\n\"There can be lots of good reasons why the first documents still aren't\nready,\" said the businessman, \"and anyway, it turned out later on that\nthe ones he submitted for me were entirely worthless.  I even read one\nof them myself, one of the officials at the court was very helpful.  It\nwas very learned, but it didn't actually say anything.  Most of all,\nthere was lots of Latin, which I can't understand, then pages and pages\nof general appeals to the court, then lots of flattery for particular\nofficials, they weren't named, these officials, but anyone familiar with\nthe court must have been able to guess who they were, then there was\nself-praise by the lawyer where he humiliated himself to the court in a\nway that was downright dog-like, and then endless investigations of\ncases from the past which were supposed to be similar to mine.\nAlthough, as far as I was able to follow them, these investigations had\nbeen carried out very carefully.  Now, I don't mean to criticise the\nlawyer's work with all of this, and the document I read was only one of\nmany, but even so, and this is something I will say, at that time I\ncouldn't see any progress in my trial at all.\"  \"And what sort of\nprogress had you been hoping for?\" asked K.  \"That's a very sensible\nquestion,\" said the businessman with a smile, \"it's only very rare that\nyou see any progress in these proceedings at all.  But I didn't know\nthat then.  I'm a businessman, much more in those days than now, I\nwanted to see some tangible progress, it should have all been moving to\nsome conclusion or at least should have been moving on in some way\naccording to the rules.  Instead of which there were just more hearings,\nand most of them went through the same things anyway; I had all the\nanswers off pat like in a church service; there were messengers from the\ncourt coming to me at work several times a week, or they came to me at\nhome or anywhere else they could find me; and that was very disturbing\nof course (but at least now things are better in that respect, it's much\nless disturbing when they contact you by telephone), and rumours about\nmy trial even started to spread among some of the people I do business\nwith, and especially my relations, so I was being made to suffer in many\ndifferent ways but there was still not the slightest sign that even the\nfirst hearing would take place soon.  So I went to the lawyer and\ncomplained about it.  He explained it all to me at length, but refused\nto do anything I asked for, no-one has any influence on the way the\ntrial proceeds, he said, to try and insist on it in any of the documents\nsubmitted - like I was asking - was simply unheard of and would do harm\nto both him and me.  I thought to myself: What this lawyer can't or\nwon't do another lawyer will.  So I looked round for other lawyers.  And\nbefore you say anything: none of them asked for a definite date for the\nmain trial and none of them got one, and anyway, apart from one\nexception which I'll talk about in a minute, it really is impossible,\nthat's one thing this lawyer didn't mislead me about; but besides, I had\nno reason to regret turning to other lawyers.  Perhaps you've already\nheard how Dr. Huld talks about the petty lawyers, he probably made them\nsound very contemptible to you, and he's right, they are contemptible.\nBut when he talks about them and compares them with himself and his\ncolleagues there's a small error running through what he says, and, just\nfor your interest, I'll tell you about it.  When he talks about the\nlawyers he mixes with he sets them apart by calling them the 'great\nlawyers'.  That's wrong, anyone can call himself 'great' if he wants to,\nof course, but in this case only the usage of the court can make that\ndistinction.  You see, the court says that besides the petty lawyers\nthere are also minor lawyers and great lawyers.  This one and his\ncolleagues are only minor lawyers, and the difference in rank between\nthem and the great lawyers, who I've only ever heard about and never\nseen, is incomparably greater than between the minor lawyers and the\ndespised petty lawyers.\"  \"The great lawyers?\" asked K.  \"Who are they\nthen?  How do you contact them?\"  \"You've never heard about them, then?\"\nsaid the businessman.  \"There's hardly anyone who's been accused who\ndoesn't spend a lot of time dreaming about the great lawyers once he's\nheard about them.  It's best if you don't let yourself be misled in that\nway.  I don't know who the great lawyers are, and there's probably no\nway of contacting them.  I don't know of any case I can talk about with\ncertainty where they've taken any part.  They do defend a lot of people,\nbut you can't get hold of them by your own efforts, they only defend\nthose who they want to defend.  And I don't suppose they ever take on\ncases that haven't already got past the lower courts.  Anyway, it's best\nnot to think about them, as if you do it makes the discussions with the\nother lawyers, all their advice and all that they do manage to achieve,\nseem so unpleasant and useless, I had that experience myself, just\nwanted to throw everything away and lay at home in bed and hear nothing\nmore about it.  But that, of course, would be the stupidest thing you\ncould do, and you wouldn't be left in peace in bed for very long\neither.\"  \"So you weren't thinking about the great lawyers at that\ntime?\" asked K.  \"Not for very long,\" said the businessman, and smiled\nagain, \"you can't forget about them entirely, I'm afraid, especially in\nthe night when these thoughts come so easily.  But I wanted immediate\nresults in those days, so I went to the petty lawyers.\"\n\n        \"Well look at you two sat huddled together!\" called Leni as she\ncame back with the dish and stood in the doorway.  They were indeed sat\nclose together, if either of them turned his head even slightly it would\nhave knocked against the other's, the businessman was not only very\nsmall but also sat hunched down, so that K. was also forced to bend down\nlow if he wanted to hear everything.  \"Not quite yet!\" called out K., to\nturn Leni away, his hand, still resting on the businessman's hand,\ntwitching with impatience.  \"He wanted me to tell him about my trial,\"\nsaid the businessman to Leni.  \"Carry on, then, carry on,\" she said.\nShe spoke to the businessman with affection but, at the same time, with\ncondescension.  K. did not like that, he had begun to learn that the man\nwas of some value after all, he had experience at least, and he was\nwilling to share it.  Leni was probably wrong about him.  He watched her\nin irritation as Leni now took the candle from the businessman's hand -\nwhich he had been holding on to all this time - wiped his hand with her\napron and then knelt beside him to scratch off some wax that had dripped\nfrom the candle onto his trousers.  \"You were about to tell me about the\npetty lawyers,\" said K., shoving Leni's hand away with no further\ncomment.  \"What's wrong with you today?\" asked Leni, tapped him gently\nand carried on with what she had been doing.  \"Yes, the petty lawyers,\"\nsaid the businessman, putting his hand to his brow as if thinking hard.\nK. wanted to help him and said, \"You wanted immediate results and so\nwent to the petty lawyers.\"\n\"Yes, that's right,\" said the businessman, but did not continue with\nwhat he'd been saying.  \"Maybe he doesn't want to speak about it in\nfront of Leni,\" thought K., suppressing his impatience to hear the rest\nstraight away, and stopped trying to press him.\n\n        \"Have you told him I'm here?\" he asked Leni.  \"Course I have,\" she\nsaid, \"he's waiting for you.  Leave Block alone now, you can talk to\nBlock later, he'll still be here.\"  K. still hesitated.  \"You'll still\nbe here?\" he asked the businessman, wanting to hear the answer from him\nand not wanting Leni to speak about the businessman as if he weren't\nthere, he was full of secret resentment towards Leni today.  And once\nmore it was only Leni who answered.  \"He often sleeps here.\"  \"He sleeps\nhere?\" exclaimed K., he had thought the businessman would just wait\nthere for him while he quickly settled his business with the lawyer, and\nthen they would leave together to discuss everything thoroughly and\nundisturbed.  \"Yes,\" said Leni, \"not everyone's like you, Josef, allowed\nto see the lawyer at any time you like.  Do don't even seem surprised\nthat the lawyer, despite being ill, still receives you at eleven o'clock\nat night.  You take it far too much for granted, what your friends do\nfor you.  Well, your friends, or at least I do, we like to do things for\nyou.  I don't want or need any more thanks than that you're fond of me.\"\n\"Fond of you?\" thought K. at first, and only then it occurred to him,\n\"Well, yes, I am fond of her.\" Nonetheless, what he said, forgetting all\nthe rest, was, \"He receives me because I am his client.  If I needed\nanyone else's help I'd have to beg and show gratitude whenever I do\nanything.\"  \"He's really nasty today, isn't he?\" Leni asked the\nbusinessman.  \"Now it's me who's not here,\" thought K., and nearly lost\nhis temper with the businessman when, with the same rudeness as Leni, he\nsaid, \"The lawyer also has other reasons to receive him.  His case is\nmuch more interesting than mine.  And it's only in its early stages too,\nit probably hasn't progressed very far so the lawyer still likes to deal\nwith him.  That'll all change later on.\"  \"Yeah, yeah,\" said Leni,\nlooking at the businessman and laughing. \"He doesn't half talk!\" she\nsaid, turning to face K.  \"You can't believe a word he says.  He's as\ntalkative as he is sweet.  Maybe that's why the lawyer can't stand him.\nAt least, he only sees him when he's in the right mood.  I've already\ntried hard to change that but it's impossible.  Just think, there are\ntimes when I tell him Block's here and he doesn't receive him until\nthree days later.  And if Block isn't on the spot when he's called then\neverything's lost and it all has to start all over again.  That's why I\nlet Block sleep here, it wouldn't be the first time Dr. Huld has wanted\nto see him in the night.  So now Block is ready for that.   Sometimes,\nwhen he knows Block is still here, he'll even change his mind about\nletting him in to see him.\"  K. looked questioningly at the businessman.\nThe latter nodded and, although he had spoken quite openly with K.\nearlier, seemed to be confused with shame as he said, \"Yes, later on you\nbecome very dependent on your lawyer.\"  \"He's only pretending to mind,\"\nsaid Leni.  \"He likes to sleep here really, he's often said so.\"  She\nwent over to a little door and shoved it open.  \"Do you want to see his\nbedroom?\" she asked.  K. went over to the low, windowless room and\nlooked in from the doorway.  The room contained a narrow bed which\nfilled it completely, so that to get into the bed you would need to\nclimb over the bedpost.  At the head of the bed there was a niche in the\nwall where, fastidiously tidy, stood a candle, a bottle of ink, and a\npen with a bundle of papers which were probably to do with the trial.\n\"You sleep in the maid's room?\" asked K., as he went back to the\nbusinessman.  \"Leni's let me have it,\" answered the businessman, \"it has\nmany advantages.\"  K. looked long at him; his first impression of the\nbusinessman had perhaps not been right; he had experience as his trial\nhad already lasted a long time, but he had paid a heavy price for this\nexperience.  K. was suddenly unable to bear the sight of the businessman\nany longer.  \"Bring him to bed, then!\" he called out to Leni, who seemed\nto understand him.  For himself, he wanted to go to the lawyer and, by\ndismissing him, free himself from not only the lawyer but also from Leni\nand the businessman.  But before he had reached the door the businessman\nspoke to him gently.  \"Excuse me, sir,\" he said, and K. looked round\ncrossly.  \"You've forgotten your promise,\" said the businessman,\nstretching his hand out to K. imploringly from where he sat.  \"You were\ngoing to tell me a secret.\"  \"That is true,\" said K., as he glanced at\nLeni, who was watching him carefully, to check on her.  \"So listen; it's\nhardly a secret now anyway.  I'm going to see the lawyer now to sack\nhim.\"  \"He's sacking him!\" yelled the businessman, and he jumped up from\nhis chair and ran around the kitchen with his arms in the air.  He kept\non shouting, \"He's sacking his lawyer!\"  Leni tried to rush at K. but\nthe businessman got in her way so that she shoved him away with her\nfists.  Then, still with her hands balled into fists, she ran after K.\nwho, however, had been given a long start.  He was already inside the\nlawyer's room by the time Leni caught up with him.  He had almost closed\nthe door behind himself, but Leni held the door open with her foot,\ngrabbed his arm and tried to pull him back.  But he put such pressure on\nher wrist that, with a sigh, she was forced to release him.  She did not\ndare go into the room straight away, and K. locked the door with the\nkey.\n\n        \"I've been waiting for you a very long time,\" said the lawyer from\nhis bed.  He had been reading something by the light of a candle but now\nhe laid it onto the bedside table and put his glasses on, looking at K.\nsharply through them.  Instead of apologising K. said, \"I'll be leaving\nagain soon.\"  As he had not apologised the lawyer ignored what K. said,\nand replied, \"I won't let you in this late again next time.\"  \"I find\nthat quite acceptable,\" said K.  The lawyer looked at him quizzically.\n\"Sit down,\" he said.  \"As you wish,\" said K., drawing a chair up to the\nbedside table and sitting down.\n\"It seemed to me that you locked the door,\" said the lawyer.  \"Yes,\"\nsaid K., \"it was because of Leni.\"  He had no intention of letting\nanyone off lightly.  But the lawyer asked him, \"Was she being\nimportunate again?\"  \"Importunate?\" asked K.  \"Yes,\" said the lawyer,\nlaughing as he did so, had a fit of coughing and then, once it had\npassed, began to laugh again.  \"I'm sure you must have noticed how\nimportunate she can be sometimes,\" he said, and patted K.'s hand which\nK. had rested on the bedside table and which he now snatched back.  \"You\ndon't attach much importance to it, then,\" said the lawyer when K. was\nsilent, \"so much the better.  Otherwise I might have needed to apologise\nto you.  It is a peculiarity of Leni's.  I've long since forgiven her\nfor it, and I wouldn't be talking of it now, if you hadn't locked the\ndoor just now.  Anyway, perhaps I should at least explain this\npeculiarity of hers to you, but you seem rather disturbed, the way\nyou're looking at me, and so that's why I'll do it, this peculiarity of\nhers consists in this; Leni finds most of the accused attractive.  She\nattaches herself to each of them, loves each of them, even seems to be\nloved by each of them; then she sometimes entertains me by telling me\nabout them when I allow her to.  I am not so astonished by all of this\nas you seem to be.  If you look at them in the right way the accused\nreally can be attractive, quite often.  But that is a remarkable and to\nsome extent scientific phenomenon.  Being indicted does not cause any\nclear, precisely definable change in a person's appearance, of course.\nBut it's not like with other legal matters, most of them remain in their\nusual way of life and, if they have a good lawyer looking after them,\nthe trial doesn't get in their way.  But there are nonetheless those who\nhave experience in these matters who can look at a crowd, however big,\nand tell you which among them is facing a charge.  How can they do that,\nyou will ask.  My answer will not please you.  It is simply that those\nwho are facing a charge are the most attractive.  It cannot be their\nguilt that makes them attractive as not all of them are guilty - at\nleast that's what I, as a lawyer, have to say - and nor can it be the\nproper punishment that has made them attractive as not all of them are\npunished, so it can only be that the proceedings levelled against them\ntake some kind of hold on them.  Whatever the reason, some of these\nattractive people are indeed very attractive.  But all of them are\nattractive, even Block, pitiful worm that he is.\"  As the lawyer\nfinished what he was saying, K. was fully in control of himself, he had\neven nodded conspicuously at his last few words in order to confirm to\nhimself the view he had already formed; that the lawyer was trying to\nconfuse him, as he always did, by making general and irrelevant\nobservations, and thus distract him from the main question of what he\nwas actually doing for K.'s trial.  The lawyer must have noticed that K.\nwas offering him more resistance than before, as he became silent,\ngiving  K. the chance to speak himself, and then, as K. also remained\nsilent, he asked, \"Did you have a particular reason for coming to see me\ntoday?\"  \"Yes,\" said K., putting his hand up to slightly shade his eyes\nfrom the light of the candle so that he could see the lawyer better, \"I\nwanted to tell you that I'm withdrawing my representation from you, with\nimmediate effect.\"  \"Do I understand you rightly?\" asked the lawyer as\nhe half raised himself in his bed and supported himself with one hand on\nthe pillow.  \"I think you do,\" said K., sitting stiffly upright as if\nwaiting in ambush.  \"Well we can certainly discuss this plan of yours,\"\nsaid the lawyer after a pause.  \"It's not a plan any more,\" said K.\n\"That may be,\" said the lawyer, \"but we still mustn't rush anything.\"\nHe used the word 'we', as if he had no intention of letting K. go free,\nand as if, even if he could no longer represent him, he could still at\nleast continue as his adviser.  \"Nothing is being rushed,\" said K.,\nstanding slowly up and going behind his chair, \"everything has been well\nthought out and probably even for too long.  The decision is final.\"\n\"Then allow me to say a few words,\" said the lawyer, throwing the bed\ncover to one side and sitting on the edge of the bed.  His naked, white-\nhaired legs shivered in the cold.  He asked K. to pass him a blanket\nfrom the couch.  K. passed him the blanket and said, \"You are running\nthe risk of catching cold for no reason.\"  \"The circumstances are\nimportant enough,\" said the lawyer as he wrapped the bed cover around\nthe top half of his body and then the blanket around his legs.  \"Your\nuncle is my friend and in the course of time I've become fond of you as\nwell.  I admit that quite openly.  There's nothing in that for me to be\nashamed of.\"  It  was very unwelcome for K. to hear the old man speak in\nthis touching way, as it forced him to explain himself more fully, which\nhe would rather have avoided, and he was aware that it also confused him\neven though it could never make him reverse his decision.  \"Thank you\nfor feeling so friendly toward me,\" he said, \"and I also realise how\ndeeply involved you've been in my case, as deeply as possible for\nyourself and to bring as much advantage as possible to me.  Nonetheless,\nI have recently come to the conviction that it is not enough.  I would\nnaturally never attempt, considering that you are so much older and more\nexperienced than I am, to convince you of my opinion; if I have ever\nunintentionally done so then I beg your forgiveness, but, as you have\njust said yourself, the circumstances are important enough and it is my\nbelief that my trial needs to be approached with much more vigour than\nhas so far been the case.\"  \"I see,\" said the lawyer, \"you've become\nimpatient.\"  \"I am not impatient,\" said K., with some irritation and he\nstopped paying so much attention to his choice of words.  \"When I first\ncame here with my uncle you probably noticed I wasn't greatly concerned\nabout my case, and if I wasn't reminded of it by force, as it were, I\nwould forget about it completely.  But my uncle insisted I should allow\nyou to represent me and I did so as a favour to him.  I could have\nexpected the case to be less of a burden than it had been, as the point\nof taking on a lawyer is that he should take on some of its weight.  But\nwhat actually happened was the opposite.  Before, the trial was never\nsuch a worry for me as it has been since you've been representing me.\nWhen I was by myself I never did anything about my case, I was hardly\naware of it, but then, once there was someone representing me,\neverything was set for something to happen, I was always, without cease,\nwaiting for you to do something, getting more and more tense, but you\ndid nothing.  I did get some information about the court from you that I\nprobably could not have got anywhere else, but that can't be enough when\nthe trial, supposedly in secret, is getting closer and closer to me.\"\nK. had pushed the chair away and stood erect, his hands in the pockets\nof his frock coat.  \"After a certain point in the proceedings,\" said the\nlawyer quietly and calmly, \"nothing new of any importance ever happens.\nSo many litigants, at the same stage in their trials, have stood before\nme just like you are now and spoken in the same way.\"  \"Then these other\nlitigants,\" said K., \"have all been right, just as I am.  That does not\nshow that I'm not.\"  \"I wasn't trying to show that you were mistaken,\"\nsaid the lawyer, \"but I wanted to add that I expected better judgement\nfrom you than from the others, especially as I've given you more insight\ninto the workings of the court and my own activities than I normally do.\nAnd now I'm forced to accept that, despite everything, you have too\nlittle trust in me.  You don't make it easy for me.\"  How the lawyer was\nhumiliating himself to K.!  He was showing no regard for the dignity of\nhis position, which on this point, must have been at its most sensitive.\nAnd why did he do that?  He did seem to be very busy as a lawyer as well\na rich man, neither the loss of income nor the loss of a client could\nhave been of much importance to him in themselves.  He was moreover\nunwell and should have been thinking of passing work on to others.  And\ndespite all that he held on tightly to K.  Why?  Was it something\npersonal for his uncle's sake, or did he really see K.'s case as one\nthat was exceptional and hoped to be able to distinguish himself with\nit, either for K.'s sake or - and this possibility could never be\nexcluded - for his friends at the court?  It was not possible to learn\nanything by looking at him, even though K. was scrutinizing him quite\nbrazenly.  It could almost be supposed he was deliberately hiding his\nthoughts as he waited to see what effect his words would have.  But he\nclearly deemed K.'s silence to be favourable for himself and he\ncontinued, \"You will have noticed the size of my office, but that I\ndon't employ any staff to help me.  That used to be quite different,\nthere was a time when several young lawyers were working for me but now\nI work alone.  This is partly to do with changes in the way I do\nbusiness, in that I concentrate nowadays more and more on matters such\nas your own case, and partly to do with the ever deeper understanding\nthat I acquire from these legal matters.  I found that I could never let\nanyone else deal with this sort of work unless I wanted to harm both the\nclient and the job I had taken on.  But the decision to do all the work\nmyself had its obvious result: I was forced to turn almost everyone away\nwho asked me to represent them and could only accept those I was\nespecially interested in - well there are enough creatures who leap at\nevery crumb I throw down, and they're not so very far away.  Most\nimportantly, I became ill from over-work.  But despite that I don't\nregret my decision, quite possibly I should have turned more cases away\nthan I did, but it did turn out to be entirely necessary for me to\ndevote myself fully to the cases I did take on, and the successful\nresults showed that it was worth it.  I once read a description of the\ndifference between representing someone in ordinary legal matters and in\nlegal matters of this sort, and the writer expressed it very well.  This\nis what he said: some lawyers lead their clients on a thread until\njudgement is passed, but there are others who immediately lift their\nclients onto their shoulders and carry them all the way to the judgement\nand beyond.  That's just how it is.  But it was quite true when I said I\nnever regret all this work.  But if, as in your case, they are so fully\nmisunderstood, well, then I come very close to regretting it.\"  All this\ntalking did more to make K. impatient than to persuade him.  From the\nway the lawyer was speaking, K. thought he could hear what he could\nexpect if he gave in, the delays and excuses would begin again, reports\nof how the documents were progressing, how the mood of the court\nofficials had improved, as well as all the enormous difficulties - in\nshort all that he had heard so many times before would be brought out\nagain even more fully, he would try to mislead K. with hopes that were\nnever specified and to make him suffer with threats that were never\nclear.  He had to put a stop to that, so he said, \"What will you\nundertake on my behalf if you continue to represent me?\"  The lawyer\nquietly accepted even this insulting question, and answered, \"I should\ncontinue with what I've already been doing for you.\"  \"That's just what\nI thought,\" said K., \"and now you don't need to say another word.\"  \"I\nwill make one more attempt,\" said the lawyer as if whatever had been\nmaking K. so annoyed was affecting him too.  \"You see, I have the\nimpression that you have not only misjudged the legal assistance I have\ngiven you but also that that misjudgement has led you to behave in this\nway, you seem, although you are the accused, to have been treated too\nwell or, to put it a better way, handled with neglect, with apparent\nneglect.  Even that has its reason; it is often better to be in chains\nthan to be free.  But I would like to show you how other defendants are\ntreated, perhaps you will succeed in learning something from it.  What I\nwill do is I will call Block in, unlock the door and sit down here\nbeside the bedside table.\"  \"Be glad to,\" said K., and did as the lawyer\nsuggested; he was always ready to learn something new.  But to make sure\nof himself for any event he added, \"but you do realise that you are no\nlonger to be my lawyer, don't you?\"  \"Yes,\" said the lawyer.  \"But you\ncan still change your mind today if you want to.\"  He lay back down in\nthe bed, pulled the quilt up to his chin and turned to face the wall.\nThen he rang.\n\n        Leni appeared almost the moment he had done so.  She looked\nhurriedly at K. and the lawyer to try and find out what had happened;\nshe seemed to be reassured by the sight of K. sitting calmly at the\nlawyer's bed.  She smiled and nodded to K., K. looked blankly back at\nher.  \"Fetch Block,\" said the lawyer.  But instead of going to fetch\nhim, Leni just went to the door and called out, \"Block!  To the lawyer!\"\nThen, probably because the lawyer had turned his face to the wall and\nwas paying no attention, she slipped in behind K.'s chair.  From then\non, she bothered him by leaning forward over the back of the chair or,\nalbeit very tenderly and carefully, she would run her hands through his\nhair and over his cheeks.  K. eventually tried to stop her by taking\nhold of one hand, and after some resistance Leni let him keep hold of\nit.  Block came as soon as he was called, but he remained standing in\nthe doorway and seemed to be wondering whether he should enter or not.\nHe raised his eyebrows and lowered his head as if listening to find out\nwhether the order to attend the lawyer would be repeated.  K. could have\nencouraged to enter, but he had decided to make a final break not only\nwith the lawyer but with everything in his home, so he kept himself\nmotionless.  Leni was also silent.  Block noticed that at least no-one\nwas chasing him away, and, on tiptoe, he entered the room, his face was\ntense, his hands were clenched behind his back.  He left the door open\nin case he needed to go back again.  K. did not even glance at him, he\nlooked instead only at the thick quilt under which the lawyer could not\nbe seen as he had squeezed up very close to the wall.  Then his voice\nwas heard: \"Block here?\" he asked.  Block had already crept some way\ninto the room but this question seemed to give him first a shove in the\nbreast and then another in the back, he seemed about to fall but\nremained standing, deeply bowed, and said, \"At your service, sir.\"\n\"What do you want?\" asked the lawyer, \"you've come at a bad time.\"\n\"Wasn't I summoned?\" asked Block, more to himself than the lawyer.  He\nheld his hands in front of himself as protection and would have been\nready to run away any moment.  \"You were summoned,\" said the lawyer,\n\"but you have still come at a bad time.\"  Then, after a pause he added,\n\"You always come at a bad time.\"  When the lawyer started speaking Block\nhad stopped looking at the bed but stared rather into one of the\ncorners, just listening, as if the light from the speaker were brighter\nthan Block could bear to look at.  But it was also difficult for him to\nlisten, as the lawyer was speaking into the wall and speaking quickly\nand quietly.  \"Would you like me to go away again, sir?\" asked Block.\n\"Well you're here now,\" said the lawyer. \"Stay!\"  It was as if the\nlawyer had not done as Block had wanted but instead threatened him with\na stick, as now Block really began to shake.  \"I went to see,\" said the\nlawyer, \"the third judge yesterday, a friend of mine, and slowly brought\nthe conversation round to the subject of you.  Do you want to know what\nhe said?\"  \"Oh, yes please,\" said Block.  The lawyer did not answer\nimmediately, so Block repeated his request and lowered his head as if\nabout to kneel down.  But then K. spoke to him:  \"What do you think\nyou're doing?\" he shouted.  Leni had wanted to stop him from calling out\nand so he took hold of her other hand.  It was not love that made him\nsqueeze it and hold on to it so tightly, she sighed frequently and tried\nto disengage her hands from him.  But Block was punished for K.'s\noutburst, as the lawyer asked him, \"Who is your lawyer?\"  \"You are,\nsir,\" said Block.  \"And who besides me?\" the lawyer asked.  \"No-one\nbesides you, sir,\" said Block.  \"And let there be no-one besides me,\"\nsaid the lawyer.  Block fully understood what that meant, he glowered at\nK., shaking his head violently.  If these actions had been translated\ninto words they would have been coarse insults.  K. had been friendly\nand willing to discuss his own case with someone like this!  \"I won't\ndisturb you any more,\" said K., leaning back in his chair.  \"You can\nkneel down or creep on all fours, whatever you like.  I won't bother\nwith you any more.\"  But Block still had some sense of pride, at least\nwhere K. was concerned, and he went towards him waving his fists,\nshouting as loudly as he dared while the lawyer was there.  \"You\nshouldn't speak to me like that, that's not allowed.  Why are you\ninsulting me?  Especially here in front of the lawyer, where both of us,\nyou and me, we're only tolerated because of his charity.  You're not a\nbetter person than me, you've been accused of something too, you're\nfacing a charge too.  If, in spite of that, you're still a gentleman\nthen I'm just as much a gentleman as you are, if not even more so.  And\nI want to be spoken to as a gentleman, especially by you.  If you think\nbeing allowed to sit there and quietly listen while I creep on all fours\nas you put it makes you something better than me, then there's an old\nlegal saying you ought to bear in mind: If you're under suspicion it's\nbetter to be moving than still, as if you're still you can be in the pan\nof the scales without knowing it and be weighed along with your sins.\"\nK. said nothing.  He merely looked in amazement at this distracted\nbeing, his eyes completely still.  He had gone through such changes in\njust the last few hours!  Was it the trial that was throwing him from\nside to side in this way and stopped him knowing who was friend and who\nwas foe?  Could he not see the lawyer was deliberately humiliating him\nand had no other purpose today than to show off his power to K., and\nperhaps even thereby subjugate K.?  But if Block was incapable of seeing\nthat, or if he so feared the lawyer that no such insight would even be\nof any use to him, how was it that he was either so sly or so bold as to\nlie to the lawyer and conceal from him the fact that he had other\nlawyers working on his behalf?  And how did he dare to attack K., who\ncould betray his secret any time he liked?  But he dared even more than\nthis, he went to the lawyer's bed and began there to make complaints\nabout K.  \"Dr. Huld, sir,\" he said, \"did you hear the way this man spoke\nto me?  You can count the length of his trial in hours, and he wants to\ntell me what to do when I've been involved in a legal case for five\nyears.  He even insults me.  He doesn't know anything, but he insults\nme, when I, as far as my weak ability allows, when I've made a close\nstudy of how to behave with the court, what we ought to do and what the\ncourt practices are.\"  \"Don't let anyone bother you,\" said the lawyer,\n\"and do what seems to you to be right.\"  \"I will,\" said Block, as if\nspeaking to himself to give himself courage, and with a quick glance to\nthe side he kneeled down close beside the bed.  \"I'm kneeling now Dr.\nHuld, sir,\" he said.  But the lawyer remained silent.  With one hand,\nBlock carefully stroked the bed cover.  In the silence while he did so,\nLeni, as she freed herself from K.'s hands, said, \"You're hurting me.\nLet go of me.  I'm going over to Block.\"  She went over to him and sat\non the edge of the bed.  Block was very pleased at this and with lively,\nbut silent, gestures he immediately urged her to intercede for him with\nthe lawyer.  It was clear that he desperately needed to be told\nsomething by the lawyer, although perhaps only so that he could make use\nof the information with his other lawyers.  Leni probably knew very well\nhow the lawyer could be brought round, pointed to his hand and pursed\nher lips as if making a kiss.  Block immediately performed the hand-kiss\nand, at further urging from Leni, repeated it twice more.  But the\nlawyer continued to be silent.  Then Leni leant over the lawyer, as she\nstretched out, the attractive shape of her body could be seen, and, bent\nover close to his face, she stroked his long white hair.  That now\nforced him to give an answer.  \"I'm rather wary of telling him,\" said\nthe lawyer, and his head could be seen shaking slightly, perhaps so that\nhe would feel the pressure of Leni's hand better.  Block listened\nclosely with his head lowered, as if by listening he were breaking an\norder.  \"What makes you so wary about it?\" asked Leni.  K. had the\nfeeling he was listening to a contrived dialogue that had been repeated\nmany times, that would be repeated many times more, and that for Block\nalone it would never lose its freshness.  \"What has his behaviour been\nlike today?\" asked the lawyer instead of an answer.  Before Leni said\nanything she looked down at Block and watched him a short while as he\nraised his hands towards her and rubbed them together imploringly.\nFinally she gave a serious nod, turned back to the lawyer and said,\n\"He's been quiet and industrious.\"  This was an elderly businessman, a\nman whose beard was long, and he was begging a young girl to speak on\nhis behalf.  Even if there was some plan behind what he did, there was\nnothing that could reinstate him in the eyes of his fellow man.  K.\ncould not understand how the lawyer could have thought this performance\nwould win him over.  Even if he had done nothing earlier to make him\nwant to leave then this scene would have done so.  It was almost\nhumiliating even for the onlooker.  So these were the lawyer's methods,\nwhich K. fortunately had not been exposed to for long, to let the client\nforget about the whole world and leave him with nothing but the hope of\nreaching the end of his trial by this deluded means.  He was no longer a\nclient, he was the lawyer's dog.  If the lawyer had ordered him to crawl\nunder the bed as if it were a kennel and to bark out from under it, then\nhe would have done so with enthusiasm.  K. listened to all of this,\ntesting it and thinking it over as if he had been given the task of\nclosely observing everything spoken here, inform a higher office about\nit and write a report.  \"And what has he been doing all day?\" asked the\nlawyer.  \"I kept him locked in the maid's room all day,\" said Leni, \"so\nthat he wouldn't stop me doing my work.  That's where he usually stays.\nFrom time to time I looked in through the spyhole to see what he was\ndoing, and each time he was kneeling on the bed and reading the papers\nyou gave him, propped up on the window sill.  That made a good\nimpression on me; as the window only opens onto an air shaft and gives\nhardly any light.  It showed how obedient he is that he was even reading\nin those conditions.\"  \"I'm pleased to hear it,\" said the lawyer.  \"But\ndid he understand what he was reading?\"  While this conversation was\ngoing on, Block continually moved his lips and was clearly formulating\nthe answers he hoped Leni would give.  \"Well I can't give you any\ncertain answer to that of course,\" said Leni, \"but I could see that he\nwas reading thoroughly.  He spent all day reading the same page, running\nhis finger along the lines.  Whenever I looked in on him he sighed as if\nthis reading was a lot of work for him.  I expect the papers you gave\nhim were very hard to understand.\"  \"Yes,\" said the lawyer, \"they\ncertainly are that.  And I really don't think he understood anything of\nthem.  But they should at least give him some inkling of just how hard a\nstruggle it is and how much work it is for me to defend him.  And who am\nI doing all this hard work for?  I'm doing it - it's laughable even to\nsay it - I'm doing it for Block.  He ought to realise what that means,\ntoo.  Did he study without a pause?\"  \"Almost without a pause,\" answered\nLeni.  \"Just the once he asked me for a drink of water, so I gave him a\nglassful through the window.  Then at eight o'clock I let him out and\ngave him something to eat.\"  Block glanced sideways at K., as if he were\nbeing praised and had to impress K. as well.  He now seemed more\noptimistic, he moved more freely and rocked back and forth on his knees.\nThis made his astonishment all the more obvious when he heard the\nfollowing words from the lawyer:  \"You speak well of him,\" said the\nlawyer, \"but that's just what makes it difficult for me.  You see, the\njudge did not speak well of him at all, neither about Block nor about\nhis case.\"  \"Didn't speak well of him?\" asked Leni.  \"How is that\npossible?\"  Block looked at her with such tension he seemed to think\nthat although the judge's words had been spoken so long before she would\nbe able to change them in his favour.  \"Not at all,\" said the lawyer.\n\"In fact he became quite cross when I started to talk about Block to\nhim. 'Don't talk to me about Block,' he said.  'He is my client,' said\nI.  'You're letting him abuse you,' he said.  'I don't think his case is\nlost yet,' said I.  'You're letting him abuse you,' he repeated.  'I\ndon't think so,' said I.  'Block works hard in his case and always knows\nwhere it stands.  He practically lives with me so that he always knows\nwhat's happening.  You don't always find such enthusiasm as that.  He's\nnot very pleasant personally, I grant you, his manners are terrible and\nhe's dirty, but as far as the trial's concerned he's quite immaculate.'\nI said immaculate, but I was deliberately exaggerating.   Then he said,\n'Block is sly, that's all.  He's accumulated plenty of experience and\nknows how to delay proceedings.  But there's more that he doesn't know\nthan he does.  What do you think he'd say if he learned his trial still\nhasn't begun, if you told him they haven't even rung the bell to\nannounce the start of proceedings?'  Alright Block, alright,\" said the\nlawyer, as at these words Block had begun to raise himself on his\ntrembling knees and clearly wanted to plead for some explanation.  It\nwas the first time the lawyer had spoken any clear words directly to\nBlock.  He looked down with his tired eyes, half blankly and half at\nBlock, who slowly sank back down on his knees under this gaze.  \"What\nthe judge said has no meaning for you,\" said the lawyer.  \"You needn't\nbe frightened at every word.  If you do it again I won't tell you\nanything else at all.  It's impossible to start a sentence without you\nlooking at me as if you were receiving your final judgement.  You should\nbe ashamed of yourself here in front of my client!  And you're\ndestroying the trust he has for me.  Just what is it you want?  You're\nstill alive, you're still under my protection.  There's no point in\nworrying!  Somewhere you've read that the final judgement can often come\nwithout warning, from anyone at any time.  And, in the right\ncircumstances, that's basically true, but it's also true that I dislike\nyour anxiety and fear and see that you don't have the trust in me you\nshould have.  Now what have I just said?  I repeated something said by\none of the judges.  You know that there are so many various opinions\nabout the procedure that they form into a great big pile and nobody can\nmake any sense of them.  This judge, for instance, sees proceedings as\nstarting at a different point from where I do.  A difference of opinion,\nnothing more.  At a certain stage in the proceedings tradition has it\nthat a sign is given by ringing a bell.  This judge sees that as the\npoint at which proceedings begin.  I can't set out all the opinions\nopposed to that view here, and you wouldn't understand it anyway,\nsuffice it to say that there are many reasons to disagree with him.\"\nEmbarrassed, Block ran his fingers through the pile of the carpet, his\nanxiety about what the judge had said had let him forget his inferior\nstatus towards the lawyer for a while, he thought only about himself and\nturned the judges words round to examine them from all sides.  \"Block,\"\nsaid Leni, as if reprimanding him, and, taking hold of the collar of his\ncoat, pulled him up slightly higher.  \"Leave the carpet alone and listen\nto what the lawyer is saying.\"\n\nThis chapter was left unfinished.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Nine\nIn the Cathedral\n\n        A very important Italian business contact of the bank had come to\nvisit the city for the first time and K. was given the task of showing\nhim some of its cultural sights.  At any other time he would have seen\nthis job as an honour but now, when he was finding it hard even to\nmaintain his current position in the bank, he accepted it only with\nreluctance.  Every hour that he could not be in the office was a cause\nof concern for him, he was no longer able to make use of his time in the\noffice anything like as well as he had previously, he spent many hours\nmerely pretending to do important work, but that only increased his\nanxiety about not being in the office.  Then he sometimes thought he saw\nthe deputy director, who was always watching, come into K.'s office, sit\nat his desk, look through his papers, receive clients who had almost\nbecome old friends of K., and lure them away from him, perhaps he even\ndiscovered mistakes, mistakes that seemed to threaten K. from a thousand\ndirections when he was at work now, and which he could no longer avoid.\nSo now, if he was ever asked to leave the office on business or even\nneeded to make a short business trip, however much an honour it seemed -\nand tasks of this sort happened to have increased substantially recently\n- there was always the suspicion that they wanted to get him out of his\noffice for a while and check his work, or at least the idea that they\nthought he was dispensable.  It would not have been difficult for him to\nturn down most of these jobs, but he did not dare to do so because, if\nhis fears had the slightest foundation, turning the jobs down would have\nbeen an acknowledgement of them.  For this reason, he never demurred\nfrom accepting them, and even when he was asked to go on a tiring\nbusiness trip lasting two days he said nothing about having to go out in\nthe rainy autumn weather when he had a severe chill, just in order to\navoid the risk of not being asked to go.  When, with a raging headache,\nhe arrived back from this trip he learned that he had been chosen to\naccompany the Italian business contact the following day.  The\ntemptation for once to turn the job down was very great, especially as\nit had no direct connection with business, but there was no denying that\nsocial obligations towards this business contact were in themselves\nimportant enough, only not for K., who knew quite well that he needed\nsome successes at work if he was to maintain his position there and\nthat, if he failed in that, it would not help him even if this Italian\nsomehow found him quite charming; he did not want to be removed from his\nworkplace for even one day, as the fear of not being allowed back in was\ntoo great, he knew full well that the fear was exaggerated but it still\nmade him anxious.  However, in this case it was almost impossible to\nthink of an acceptable excuse, his knowledge of Italian was not great\nbut still good enough; the deciding factor was that K. had earlier known\na little about art history and this had become widely known around the\nbank in extremely exaggerated form, and that K. had been a member of the\nSociety for the Preservation of City Monuments, albeit only for business\nreasons.  It was said that this Italian was an art lover, so the choice\nof K. to accompany him was a matter of course.\n\n        It was a very rainy and stormy morning when K., in a foul temper\nat the thought of the day ahead of him, arrived early at seven o'clock\nin the office so that he could at least do some work before his visitor\nwould prevent him.  He had spent half the night studying a book of\nItalian grammar so that he would be somewhat prepared and was very\ntired; his desk was less attractive to him than the window where he had\nspent far too much time sitting of late, but he resisted the temptation\nand sat down to his work.  Unfortunately, just then the servitor came in\nand reported that the director had sent him to see whether the chief\nclerk was already in his office; if he was, then would he please be so\nkind as to come to his reception room as the gentleman from Italy was\nalready there.  \"I'll come straight away,\" said K.  He put a small\ndictionary in his pocket, took a guide to the city's tourist sites under\nhis arm that he had compiled for strangers, and went through the deputy\ndirector's office into that of the director.  He was glad he had come\ninto the office so early and was able to be of service immediately,\nnobody could seriously have expected that of him.  The deputy director's\noffice was, of course, still as empty as the middle of the night, the\nservitor had probably been asked to summon him too but without success.\nAs K. entered the reception room two men stood up from the deep\narmchairs where they had been sitting.  The director gave him a friendly\nsmile, he was clearly very glad that K. was there, he immediately\nintroduced him to the Italian who shook K.'s hand vigorously and joked\nthat somebody was an early riser.  K. did not quite understand whom he\nhad in mind, it was moreover an odd expression to use and it took K. a\nlittle while to guess its meaning.  He replied with a few bland phrases\nwhich the Italian received once more with a laugh, passing his hand\nnervously and repeatedly over his blue-grey, bushy moustache.  This\nmoustache was obviously perfumed, it was almost tempting to come close\nto it and sniff.  When they had all sat down and begun a light\npreliminary conversation, K. was disconcerted to notice that he\nunderstood no more than fragments of what the Italian said.  When he\nspoke very calmly he understood almost everything, but that was very\ninfrequent, mostly the words gushed from his mouth and he seemed to be\nenjoying himself so much his head shook.  When he was talking in this\nway his speech was usually wrapped up in some kind of dialect which\nseemed to K. to have nothing to do with Italian but which the director\nnot only understood but also spoke, although K. ought to have foreseen\nthis as the Italian came from the south of his country where the\ndirector had also spent several years.  Whatever the cause, K. realised\nthat the possibility of communicating with the Italian had been largely\ntaken from him, even his French was difficult to understand, and his\nmoustache concealed the movements of his lips which might have offered\nsome help in understanding what he said.  K. began to anticipate many\ndifficulties,  he gave up trying to understand what the Italian said -\nwith the director there, who could understand him so easily, it would\nhave been pointless effort - and for the time being did no more than\nscowl at the Italian as he relaxed sitting deep but comfortable in the\narmchair, as he frequently pulled at his short, sharply tailored jacket\nand at one time lifted his arms in the air and moved his hands freely to\ntry and depict something that K. could not grasp, even though he was\nleaning forward and did not let the hands out of his sight.   K. had\nnothing to occupy himself but mechanically watch the exchange between\nthe two men and his tiredness finally made itself felt, to his alarm,\nalthough fortunately in good time, he once caught himself nearly getting\nup, turning round and leaving.  Eventually the Italian looked at the\nclock and jumped up.  After taking his leave from the director he turned\nto K., pressing himself so close to him that K. had to push his chair\nback just so that he could move.  The director had, no doubt, seen the\nanxiety in K.'s eyes as he tried to cope with this dialect of Italian,\nhe joined in with this conversation in a way that was so adroit and\nunobtrusive that he seemed to be adding no more than minor comments,\nwhereas in fact he was swiftly and patiently breaking into what the\nItalian said so that K. could understand.  K. learned in this way that\nthe Italian first had a few business matters to settle, that he\nunfortunately had only a little time at his disposal, that he certainly\ndid not intend to rush round to see every monument in the city, that he\nwould much rather - at least as long as K. would agree, it was entirely\nhis decision  - just see the cathedral and to do so thoroughly.  He was\nextremely pleased to be accompanied by someone who was so learned and so\npleasant - by this he meant K., who was occupied not with listening to\nthe Italian but the director - and asked if he would be so kind, if the\ntime was suitable, to meet him in the cathedral in two hours' time at\nabout ten o'clock.  He hoped he would certainly be able to be there at\nthat time.  K. made an appropriate reply, the Italian shook first the\ndirector's hand and then K.'s, then the director's again and went to the\ndoor, half turned to the two men who followed him and continuing to talk\nwithout a break.  K. remained together with the director for a short\nwhile, although the director looked especially unhappy today.  He\nthought he needed to apologise to K. for something and told him - they\nwere standing intimately close together - he had thought at first he\nwould accompany the Italian himself, but then - he gave no more precise\nreason than this - then he decided it would be better to send K. with\nhim.  He should not be surprised if he could not understand the Italian\nat first, he would be able to very soon, and even if he really could not\nunderstand very much he said it was not so bad, as it was really not so\nimportant for the Italian to be understood.  And anyway, K.'s knowledge\nof Italian was surprisingly good, the director was sure he would get by\nvery well.  And with that, it was time for K. to go.  He spent the time\nstill remaining to him with a dictionary, copying out obscure words he\nwould need to guide the Italian round the cathedral.  It was an\nextremely irksome task, servitors brought him the mail, bank staff came\nwith various queries and, when they saw that K. was busy, stood by the\ndoor and did not go away until he had listened to them, the deputy\ndirector did not miss the opportunity to disturb K. and came in\nfrequently, took the dictionary from his hand and flicked through its\npages, clearly for no purpose, when the door to the ante-room opened\neven clients would appear from the  half darkness and bow timidly to him\n- they wanted to attract his attention but were not sure whether he had\nseen them - all this activity was circling around K. with him at its\ncentre while he compiled the list of words he would need, then looked\nthem up in the dictionary, then wrote them out, then practised their\npronunciation and finally tried to learn them by heart.  The good\nintentions he had had earlier, though, seemed to have left him\ncompletely, it was the Italian who had caused him all this effort and\nsometimes he became so angry with him that he buried the dictionary\nunder some papers firmly intending to do no more preparation, but then\nhe realised he could not walk up and down in the cathedral with the\nItalian without saying a word, so, in an even greater rage, he\npulled the dictionary back out again.\n\n        At exactly half past nine, just when he was about to leave, there\nwas a telephone call for him, Leni wished him good morning and asked how\nhe was, K. thanked her hurriedly and told her it was impossible for him\nto talk now as he had to go to the cathedral. \"To the cathedral?\" asked\nLeni.  \"Yes, to the cathedral.\"  \"What do you have to go to the\ncathedral for?\" said Leni.  K. tried to explain it to her briefly, but\nhe had hardly begun when Leni suddenly said, \"They're harassing you.\"\nOne thing that K. could not bear was pity that he had not wanted or\nexpected, he took his leave of her with two words, but as he put the\nreceiver back in its place he said, half to himself and half to the girl\non the other end of the line who could no longer hear him, \"Yes, they're\nharassing me.\"\n\n        By now the time was late and there was almost a danger he would\nnot be on time.  He took a taxi to the cathedral, at the last moment he\nhad remembered the album that he had had no opportunity to give to the\nItalian earlier and so took it with him now.  He held it on his knees\nand drummed impatiently on it during the whole journey.  The rain had\neased off slightly but it was still damp chilly and dark, it would be\ndifficult to see anything in the cathedral but standing about on cold\nflagstones might well make K.'s chill much worse.  The square in front\nof the cathedral was quite empty, K. remembered how even as a small\nchild he had noticed that nearly all the houses in this narrow square\nhad the curtains at their windows closed most of the time, although\ntoday, with the weather like this, it was more understandable.  The\ncathedral also seemed quite empty, of course no-one would think of going\nthere on a day like this.  K. hurried along both the side naves but saw\nno-one but an old woman who, wrapped up in a warm shawl, was kneeling at\na picture of the Virgin Mary and staring up at it.  Then, in the\ndistance, he saw a church official who limped away through a doorway in\nthe wall.  K. had arrived on time, it had struck ten just as he was\nentering the building, but the Italian still was not there.  K. went\nback to the main entrance, stood there indecisively for a while, and\nthen walked round the cathedral in the rain in case the Italian was\nwaiting at another entrance.  He was nowhere to be found.  Could the\ndirector have misunderstood what time they had agreed on?  How could\nanyone understand someone like that properly anyway?  Whatever had\nhappened, K. would have to wait for him for at least half an hour.  As\nhe was tired he wanted to sit down, he went back inside the cathedral,\nhe found something like a small carpet on one of the steps, he moved it\nwith his foot to a nearby pew, wrapped himself up tighter in his coat,\nput the collar up and sat down.  To pass the time he opened the album\nand flicked through the pages a little but soon had to give up as it\nbecame so dark that when he looked up he could hardly make out anything\nin the side nave next to him.\n\n        In the distance there was a large triangle of candles flickering\non the main altar, K. was not certain whether he had seen them earlier.\nPerhaps they had only just been lit.  Church staff creep silently as\npart of their job, you don't notice them.  When K. happened to turn\nround he also saw a tall, stout candle attached to a column not far\nbehind him.  It was all very pretty, but totally inadequate to\nilluminate the pictures which were usually left in the darkness of the\nside altars, and seemed to make the darkness all the deeper.  It was\ndiscourteous of the Italian not to come but it was also sensible of him,\nthere would have been nothing to see, they would have had to content\nthemselves with seeking out a few pictures with K.'s electric pocket\ntorch and looking at them one small part at a time.  K. went over to a\nnearby side chapel to see what they could have hoped for, he went up a\nfew steps to a low marble railing and leant over it to look at the altar\npicture by the light of his torch.  The eternal light hung disturbingly\nin front of it.  The first thing that K. partly saw and partly guessed\nat was a large knight in armour who was shown at the far edge of the\npainting.  He was leaning on his sword that he had stuck into the naked\nground in front of him where only a few blades of grass grew here and\nthere.  He seemed to be paying close attention to something that was\nbeing played out in front of him.  It was astonishing to see how he\nstood there without going any closer.  Perhaps it was his job to stand\nguard.  It was a long time since K. had looked at any pictures and he\nstudied the knight for a long time even though he had continually to\nblink as he found it difficult to bear the green light of his torch.\nThen when he moved the light to the other parts of the picture he found\nan interment of Christ shown in the usual way, it was also a\ncomparatively new painting.  He put his torch away and went back to his\nplace.\n\n        There seemed to be no point in waiting for the Italian any longer,\nbut outside it was certainly raining heavily, and as it was not so cold\nin the cathedral as K. had expected he decided to stay there for the\ntime being.  Close by him was the great pulpit, there were two plain\ngolden crosses attached to its little round roof which were lying almost\nflat and whose tips crossed over each other.  The outside of the\npulpit's balustrade was covered in green foliage which continued down to\nthe column supporting it, little angels could be seen among the leaves,\nsome of them lively and some of them still.  K. walked up to the pulpit\nand examined it from all sides, its stonework had been sculpted with\ngreat care, it seemed as if the foliage had trapped a deep darkness\nbetween and behind its leaves and held it there prisoner, K. lay his\nhand in one of these gaps and cautiously felt the stone, until then he\nhad been totally unaware of this pulpit's existence.  Then K. happened\nto notice one of the church staff standing behind the next row of pews,\nhe wore a loose, creased, black cassock, he held a snuff box in his left\nhand and he was watching K.  Now what does he want? thought K.  Do I\nseem suspicious to him?  Does he want a tip?  But when the man in the\ncassock saw that K. had noticed him he raised his right hand, a pinch of\nsnuff still held between two fingers, and pointed in some vague\ndirection.  It was almost impossible to understand what this behaviour\nmeant, K. waited a while longer but the man in the cassock did not stop\ngesturing with his hand and even augmented it by nodding his head.  \"Now\nwhat does he want?\" asked K. quietly, he did not dare call out loud\nhere; but then he drew out his purse and pushed his way through the\nnearest pews to reach the man.  He, however, immediately gestured to\nturn down this offer, shrugged his shoulders and limped away.  As a\nchild K. had imitated riding on a horse with the same sort of movement\nas this limp.  \"This old man is like a child,\" thought K., \"he doesn't\nhave the sense for anything more than serving in a church.  Look at the\nway he stops when I stop, and how he waits to see whether I'll\ncontinue.\"  With a smile, K. followed the old man all the way up the\nside nave and almost as far as the main altar, all this time the old man\ncontinued to point at something but K. deliberately avoided looking\nround, he was only pointing in order to make it harder for K. to follow\nhim.  Eventually, K. did stop following, he did not want to worry the\nold man too much, and he also did not want to frighten him away\ncompletely in case the Italian turned up after all.\n\n        When he entered the central nave to go back to where he had left\nthe album, he noticed a small secondary pulpit on a column almost next\nto the stalls by the altar where the choir sat.  It was very simple,\nmade of plain white stone, and so small that from a distance it looked\nlike an empty niche where the statue of a saint ought to have been.  It\ncertainly would have been impossible for the priest to take a full step\nback from the balustrade, and, although there was no decoration on it,\nthe top of the pulpit curved in exceptionally low so that a man of\naverage height would not be able stand upright and would have to remain\nbent forward over the balustrade.  In all, it looked as if it had been\nintended to make the priest suffer, it was impossible to understand why\nthis pulpit would be needed as there were also the other ones available\nwhich were large and so artistically decorated.\n\n        And K. would certainly not have noticed this little pulpit if\nthere had not been a lamp fastened above it, which usually meant there\nwas a sermon about to be given.  So was a sermon to be given now?  In\nthis empty church?  K. looked down at the steps which, pressed close\nagainst the column, led up to the pulpit.  They were so narrow they\nseemed to be there as decoration on the column rather than for anyone to\nuse.  But under the pulpit - K. grinned in astonishment - there really\nwas a priest standing with his hand on the handrail ready to climb the\nsteps and looking at K.  Then he nodded very slightly, so that K.\ncrossed himself and genuflected as he should have done earlier.  With a\nlittle swing, the priest went up into the pulpit with short fast steps.\nWas there really a sermon about to begin?  Maybe the man in the cassock\nhad not been really so demented, and had meant to lead K.'s way to the\npreacher, which in this empty church would have been very necessary.\nAnd there was also, somewhere in front of a picture of the Virgin Mary,\nan old woman who should have come to hear the sermon.  And if there was\nto be a sermon why had it not been introduced on the organ?  But the\norgan remained quiet and merely looked out weakly from the darkness of\nits great height.\n\n        K. now considered whether he should leave as quickly as possible,\nif he did not do it now there would be no chance of doing so during the\nsermon and he would have to stay there for as long as it lasted, he had\nlost so much time when he should have been in his office, there had long\nbeen no need for him to wait for the Italian any longer, he looked at\nhis watch, it was eleven.  But could there really be a sermon given?\nCould K. constitute the entire congregation?  How could he when he was\njust a stranger who wanted to look at the church?  That, basically, was\nall he was.  The idea of a sermon, now, at eleven o'clock, on a workday,\nin hideous weather, was nonsense.  The priest - there was no doubt that\nhe was a priest, a young man with a smooth, dark face - was clearly\ngoing up there just to put the lamp out after somebody had lit it by\nmistake.\n\n        But there had been no mistake, the priest seemed rather to check\nthat the lamp was lit and turned it a little higher, then he slowly\nturned to face the front and leant down on the balustrade gripping its\nangular rail with both hands.  He stood there like that for a while and,\nwithout turning his head, looked around.  K. had moved back a long way\nand leant his elbows on the front pew.  Somewhere in the church - he\ncould not have said exactly where - he could make out the man in the\ncassock hunched under his bent back and at peace, as if his work were\ncompleted.  In the cathedral it was now very quiet!  But K. would have\nto disturb that silence, he had no intention of staying there; if it was\nthe priest's duty to preach at a certain time regardless of the\ncircumstances then he could, and he could do it without K.'s taking\npart, and K.'s presence would do nothing to augment the effect of it.\nSo K. began slowly to move, felt his way on tiptoe along the pew,\narrived at the broad aisle and went along it without being disturbed,\nexcept for the sound of his steps, however light, which rang out on the\nstone floor and resounded from the vaulting, quiet but continuous at a\nrepeating, regular pace.  K. felt slightly abandoned as, probably\nobserved by the priest, he walked by himself between the empty pews, and\nthe size of the cathedral seemed to be just at the limit of what a man\ncould bear.  When he arrived back at where he had been sitting he did\nnot hesitate but simply reached out for the album he had left there and\ntook it with him.  He had nearly left the area covered by pews and was\nclose to the  empty space between himself and the exit when, for the\nfirst time, he heard the voice of the priest.  A powerful and\nexperienced voice.  It pierced through the reaches of the cathedral\nready waiting for it!  But the priest was not calling out to the\ncongregation, his cry was quite unambiguous and there was no escape from\nit, he called \"Josef K.!\"\n\n        K. stood still and looked down at the floor.  In theory he was\nstill free, he could have carried on walking, through one of three dark\nlittle wooden doors not far in front of him and away from there.  It\nwould simply mean he had not understood, or that he had understood but\nchose not to pay attention to it.  But if he once turned round he would\nbe trapped, then he would have acknowledged that he had understood\nperfectly well, that he really was the Josef K. the priest had called to\nand that he was willing to follow.  If the priest had called out again\nK. would certainly have carried on out the door, but everything was\nsilent as K. also waited, he turned his head slightly as he wanted to\nsee what the priest was doing now.  He was merely standing in the pulpit\nas before, but it was obvious that he had seen K. turn his head.  If K.\ndid not now turn round completely it would have been like a child\nplaying hide and seek.  He did so, and the priest beckoned him with his\nfinger.  As everything could now be done openly he ran - because of\ncuriosity and the wish to get it over with - with long flying leaps\ntowards the pulpit.  At the front pews he stopped, but to the priest he\nstill seemed too far away, he reached out his hand and pointed sharply\ndown with his finger to a place immediately in front of the pulpit.  And\nK. did as he was told, standing in that place he had to bend his head a\nlong way back just to see the priest.  \"You are Josef K.,\" said the\npriest, and raised his hand from the balustrade to make a gesture whose\nmeaning was unclear.  \"Yes,\" said K., he considered how freely he had\nalways given his name in the past, for some time now it had been a\nburden to him, now there were people who knew his name whom he had never\nseen before, it had been so nice first to introduce yourself and only\nthen for people to know who you were.  \"You have been accused,\" said the\npriest, especially gently.  \"Yes,\" said K., \"so I have been informed.\"\n\"Then you are the one I am looking for,\" said the priest.  \"I am the\nprison chaplain.\"  \"I see,\" said K.  \"I had you summoned here,\" said the\npriest, \"because I wanted to speak to you.\"  \"I knew nothing of that,\"\nsaid K.  \"I came here to show the cathedral to a gentleman from Italy.\"\n\"That is beside the point,\" said the priest.  \"What are you holding in\nyour hand?  Is it a prayer book?\"  \"No,\" answered K., \"it's an album of\nthe city's tourist sights.\"  \"Put it down,\" said the priest.  K. threw\nit away with such force that it flapped open and rolled across the\nfloor, tearing its pages.  \"Do you know your case is going badly?\" asked\nthe priest.  \"That's how it seems to me too,\" said K.  \"I've expended a\nlot of effort on it, but so far with no result.  Although I do still\nhave some documents to submit.\"  \"How do you imagine it will end?\" asked\nthe priest.  \"At first I thought it was bound to end well,\" said K.,\n\"but now I have my doubts about it.  I don't know how it will end.  Do\nyou know?\"  \"I don't,\" said the priest, \"but I fear it will end badly.\nYou are considered guilty.  Your case will probably not even go beyond a\nminor court.  Provisionally at least, your guilt is seen as proven.\"\n\"But I'm not guilty,\" said K., \"there's been a mistake.  How is it even\npossible for someone to be guilty.  We're all human beings here, one\nlike the other.\"  \"That is true,\" said the priest, \"but that is how the\nguilty speak.\"  \"Do you presume I'm guilty too?\" asked K.  \"I make no\npresumptions about you,\" said the priest.  \"I thank you for that,\" said\nK. \"but everyone else involved in these proceedings has something\nagainst me and presumes I'm guilty.  They even influence those who\naren't involved.  My position gets harder all the time.\"  \"You don't\nunderstand the facts,\" said the priest, \"the verdict does not come\nsuddenly, proceedings continue until a verdict is reached gradually.\"\n\"I see,\" said K., lowering his head.  \"What do you intend to do about\nyour case next?\" asked the priest.  \"I still need to find help,\" said\nK., raising his head to see what the priest thought of this.  \"There are\nstill certain possibilities I haven't yet made use of.\"  \"You look for\ntoo much help from people you don't know,\" said the priest\ndisapprovingly, \"and especially from women.  Can you really not see\nthat's not the help you need?\"  \"Sometimes, in fact quite often, I could\nbelieve you're right,\" said K., \"but not always.  Women have a lot of\npower.  If I could persuade some of the women I know to work together\nwith me then I would be certain to succeed.  Especially in a court like\nthis that seems to consist of nothing but woman-chasers.  Show the\nexamining judge a woman in the distance and he'll run right over the\ndesk, and the accused, just to get to her as soon as he can.\"  The\npriest lowered his head down to the balustrade, only now did the roof\nover the pulpit seem to press him down.  What sort of dreadful weather\ncould it be outside?  It was no longer just a dull day, it was deepest\nnight.  None of the stained glass in the main window shed even a flicker\nof light on the darkness of the walls.  And this was the moment when the\nman in the cassock chose to put out the candles on the main altar, one\nby one.  \"Are you cross with me?\" asked K.  \"Maybe you don't know what\nsort of court it is you serve.\"  He received no answer.  \"Well, it's\njust my own experience,\" said K.  Above him there was still silence.  \"I\ndidn't mean to insult you,\" said K.  At that, the priest screamed down\nat K.:  \"Can you not see two steps in front of you?\"  He shouted in\nanger, but it was also the scream of one who sees another fall and,\nshocked and without thinking, screams against his own will.\n\n        The two men, then, remained silent for a long time.  In the\ndarkness beneath him, the priest could not possibly have seen K.\ndistinctly, although K. was able to see him clearly by the light of the\nlittle lamp.  Why did the priest not come down?  He had not given a\nsermon, he had only told K. a few things which, if he followed them\nclosely, would probably cause him more harm than good.  But the priest\ncertainly seemed to mean well, it might even be possible, if he would\ncome down and cooperate with him, it might even be possible for him to\nobtain some acceptable piece of advice that could make all the\ndifference, it might, for instance, be able to show him not so much to\ninfluence the proceedings but how to break free of them, how to evade\nthem, how to live away from them.  K. had to admit that this was\nsomething he had had on his mind quite a lot of late.  If the priest\nknew of such a possibility he might, if K. asked him, let him know about\nit, even though he was part of the court himself and even though, when\nK. had criticised the court, he had held down his gentle nature and\nactually shouted at K.\n\n        \"Would you not like to come down here?\" asked K.  \"If you're not\ngoing to give a sermon come down here with me.\"  \"Now I can come down,\"\nsaid the priest, perhaps he regretted having shouted at K.  As he took\ndown the lamp from its hook he said, \"to start off with I had to speak\nto you from a distance.  Otherwise I'm too easily influenced and forget\nmy duty.\"\n\n        K. waited for him at the foot of the steps.  While he was still on\none of the higher steps as he  came down them the priest reached out his\nhand for K. to shake.  \"Can you spare me a little of your time?\" asked\nK.  \"As much time as you need,\" said the priest, and passed him the\nlittle lamp for him to carry.  Even at close distance the priest did not\nlose a certain solemnity that seemed to be part of his character.  \"You\nare very friendly towards me,\" said K., as they walked up and down\nbeside each other in the darkness of one of the side naves.  \"That makes\nyou an exception among all those who belong to the court.  I can trust\nyou more than any of the others I've seen.  I can speak openly with\nyou.\"  \"Don't fool yourself,\" said the priest.  \"How would I be fooling\nmyself?\" asked K.  \"You fool yourself in the court,\" said the priest,\n\"it talks about this self-deceit in the opening paragraphs to the law.\nIn front of the law there is a doorkeeper.  A man from the countryside\ncomes up to the door and asks for entry.  But the doorkeeper says he\ncan't let him in to the law right now.  The man thinks about this, and\nthen he asks if he'll be able to go in later on.  'That's possible,'\nsays the doorkeeper, 'but not now'.  The gateway to the law is open as\nit always is, and the doorkeeper has stepped to one side, so the man\nbends over to try and see in.  When the doorkeeper notices this he\nlaughs and says, 'If you're tempted give it a try, try and go in even\nthough I say you can't.  Careful though: I'm powerful.  And I'm only the\nlowliest of all the doormen.  But there's a doorkeeper for each of the\nrooms and each of them is more powerful than the last.  It's more than I\ncan stand just to look at the third one.'  The man from the country had\nnot expected difficulties like this, the law was supposed to be\naccessible for anyone at any time, he thinks, but now he looks more\nclosely at the doorkeeper in his fur coat, sees his big hooked nose, his\nlong thin tartar-beard, and he decides it's better to wait until he has\npermission to enter.  The doorkeeper gives him a stool and lets him sit\ndown to one side of the gate.  He sits there for days and years.  He\ntries to be allowed in time and again and tires the doorkeeper with his\nrequests.  The doorkeeper often questions him, asking about where he's\nfrom and many other things, but these are disinterested questions such\nas great men ask, and he always ends up by telling him he still can't\nlet him in.  The man had come well equipped for his journey, and uses\neverything, however valuable, to bribe the doorkeeper.  He accepts\neverything, but as he does so he says, 'I'll only accept this so that\nyou don't think there's anything you've failed to do'.  Over many years,\nthe man watches the doorkeeper almost without a break.  He forgets about\nthe other doormen, and begins to think this one is the only thing\nstopping him from gaining access to the law. Over the first few years he\ncurses his unhappy condition out loud, but later, as he becomes old, he\njust grumbles to himself.  He becomes senile, and as he has come to know\neven the fleas in the doorkeeper's fur collar over the years that he has\nbeen studying him he even asks them to help him and change the\ndoorkeeper's mind.  Finally his eyes grow dim, and he no longer knows\nwhether it's really getting darker or just his eyes that are deceiving\nhim.  But he seems now to see an inextinguishable light begin to shine\nfrom the darkness behind the door.  He doesn't have long to live now.\nJust before he dies, he brings together all his experience from all this\ntime into one question which he has still never put to the doorkeeper.\nHe beckons to him, as he's no longer able to raise his stiff body.  The\ndoorkeeper has to bend over deeply as the difference in their sizes has\nchanged very much to the disadvantage of the man.  'What is it you want\nto know now?' asks the doorkeeper, 'You're insatiable.'  'Everyone wants\naccess to the law,' says the man, 'how come, over all these years, no-\none but me has asked to be let in?'  The doorkeeper can see the man's\ncome to his end, his hearing has faded, and so, so that he can be heard,\nhe shouts to him: 'Nobody else could have got in this way, as this\nentrance was meant only for you.  Now I'll go and close it'.\"\n\n        \"So the doorkeeper cheated the man,\" said K. immediately, who had\nbeen captivated by the story.  \"Don't be too quick,\" said the priest,\n\"don't take somebody else's opinion without checking it.  I told you the\nstory exactly as it was written.  There's nothing in there about\ncheating.\"  \"But it's quite clear,\" said K., \"and your first\ninterpretation of it was quite correct.  The doorkeeper gave him the\ninformation that would release him only when it could be of no more\nuse.\"  \"He didn't ask him before that,\" said the priest, \"and don't\nforget he was only a doorkeeper, and as doorkeeper he did his duty.\"\n\"What makes you think he did his duty?\" asked K., \"He didn't.  It might\nhave been his duty to keep everyone else away, but this man is who the\ndoor was intended for and he ought to have let him in.\"  \"You're not\npaying enough attention to what was written and you're changing the\nstory,\" said the priest.  \"According to the story, there are two\nimportant things that the doorkeeper explains about access to the law,\none at the beginning, one at the end.  At one place he says he can't\nallow him in now, and at the other he says this entrance was intended\nfor him alone.  If one of the statements contradicted the other you\nwould be right and the doorkeeper would have cheated the man from the\ncountry.  But there is no contradiction.  On the contrary, the first\nstatement even hints at the second.  You could almost say the doorkeeper\nwent beyond his duty in that he offered the man some prospect of being\nadmitted in the future.  Throughout the story, his duty seems to have\nbeen merely to turn the man away, and there are many commentators who\nare surprised that the doorkeeper offered this hint at all, as he seems\nto love exactitude and keeps strict guard over his position.  He stays\nat his post for many years and doesn't close the gate until the very\nend, he's very conscious of the importance of his service, as he says,\n'I'm powerful,' he has respect for his superiors, as he says, 'I'm only\nthe lowliest of the doormen', he's not talkative, as through all these\nyears the only questions he asks are 'disinterested', he's not\ncorruptible, as when he's offered a gift he says, 'I'll only accept this\nso that you don't think there's anything you've failed to do,' as far as\nfulfilling his duty goes he can be neither ruffled nor begged, as it\nsays about the man that, 'he tires the doorkeeper with his requests',\neven his external appearance suggests a pedantic character, the big\nhooked nose and the long, thin, black tartar-beard.  How could any\ndoorkeeper be more faithful to his duty?  But in the doorkeeper's\ncharacter there are also other features which might be very useful for\nthose who seek entry to the law, and when he hinted at some possibility\nin the future it always seemed to make it clear that he might even go\nbeyond his duty.  There's no denying he's a little simple minded, and\nthat makes him a little conceited.  Even if all he said about his power\nand the power of the other doorkeepers and how not even he could bear\nthe sight of them - I say even if all these assertions are right, the\nway he makes them shows that he's too simple and arrogant to understand\nproperly.  The commentators say about this that, 'correct understanding\nof a matter and a misunderstanding of the same matter are not mutually\nexclusive'.  Whether they're right or not, you have to concede that his\nsimplicity and arrogance, however little they show, do weaken his\nfunction of guarding the entrance, they are defects in the doorkeeper's\ncharacter.  You also have to consider that the doorkeeper seems to be\nfriendly by nature, he isn't always just an official.  He makes a joke\nright at the beginning, in that he invites the man to enter at the same\ntime as maintaining the ban on his entering, and then he doesn't send\nhim away but gives him, as it says in the text, a stool to sit on and\nlets him stay by the side of the door.  The patience with which he puts\nup with the man's requests through all these years, the little\nquestioning sessions, accepting the gifts, his politeness when he puts\nup with the man cursing his fate even though it was the doorkeeper who\ncaused that fate - all these things seem to want to arouse our sympathy.\nNot every doorkeeper would have behaved in the same way.  And finally,\nhe lets the man beckon him and he bends deep down to him so that he can\nput his last question.  There's no more than some slight impatience -\nthe doorkeeper knows everything's come to its end - shown in the words,\n'You're insatiable'.  There are many commentators who go even further in\nexplaining it in this way and think the words, 'you're insatiable' are\nan expression of friendly admiration, albeit with some condescension.\nHowever you look at it the figure of the doorkeeper comes out\ndifferently from how you might think.\"  \"You know the story better than\nI do and you've known it for longer,\" said K.  They were silent for a\nwhile.  And then K. said, \"So you think the man was not cheated, do\nyou?\"  \"Don't get me wrong,\" said the priest, \"I'm just pointing out the\ndifferent opinions about it.  You shouldn't pay too much attention to\npeople's opinions.  The text cannot be altered, and the various opinions\nare often no more than an expression of despair over it.  There's even\none opinion which says it's the doorkeeper who's been cheated.\"  \"That\ndoes seem to take things too far,\" said K.  \"How can they argue the\ndoorkeeper has been cheated?\"  \"Their argument,\" answered the priest,\n\"is based on the simplicity of the doorkeeper.  They say the doorkeeper\ndoesn't know the inside of the law, only the way into it where he just\nwalks up and down.  They see his ideas of what's inside the law as\nrather childish, and suppose he's afraid himself of what he wants to\nmake the man frightened of.  Yes, he's more afraid of it than the man,\nas the man wants nothing but to go inside the law, even after he's heard\nabout the terrible doormen there, in contrast to the doorkeeper who\ndoesn't want to go in, or at least we don't hear anything about it.  On\nthe other hand, there are those who say he must have already been inside\nthe law as he has been taken on into its service and that could only\nhave been done inside.  That can be countered by supposing he could have\nbeen given the job of doorkeeper by somebody calling out from inside,\nand that he can't have gone very far inside as he couldn't bear the\nsight of the third doorkeeper.  Nor, through all those years, does the\nstory say the doorkeeper told the man anything about the inside, other\nthan his comment about the other doorkeepers.  He could have been\nforbidden to do so, but he hasn't said anything about that either.  All\nthis seems to show he doesn't know anything about what the inside looks\nlike or what it means, and that that's why he's being deceived.  But\nhe's also being deceived by the man from the country as he's this man's\nsubordinate and doesn't know it.  There's a lot to indicate that he\ntreats the man as his subordinate, I expect you remember, but those who\nhold this view would say it's very clear that he really is his\nsubordinate.   Above all, the free man is superior to the man who has to\nserve another.  Now, the man really is free, he can go wherever he\nwants, the only thing forbidden to him is entry into the law and, what's\nmore, there's only one man forbidding him to do so - the doorkeeper.  If\nhe takes the stool and sits down beside the door and stays there all his\nlife he does this of his own free will, there's nothing in the story to\nsay he was forced to do it.  On the other hand, the doorkeeper is kept\nto his post by his employment, he's not allowed to go away from it and\nit seems he's not allowed to go inside either, not even if he wanted to.\nAlso, although he's in the service of the law he's only there for this\none entrance, therefore he's there only in the service of this one man\nwho the door's intended for.  This is another way in which he's his\nsubordinate.  We can take it that he's been performing this somewhat\nempty service for many years, through the whole of a man's life, as it\nsays that a man will come, that means someone old enough to be a man.\nThat means the doorkeeper will have to wait a long time before his\nfunction is fulfilled, he will have to wait for as long as the man\nliked, who came to the door of his own free will.  Even the end of the\ndoorkeeper's service is determined by when the man's life ends, so the\ndoorkeeper remains his subordinate right to the end.  And it's pointed\nout repeatedly that the doorkeeper seems to know nothing of any of this,\nalthough this is not seen as anything remarkable, as those who hold this\nview see the doorkeeper as deluded in a way that's far worse, a way\nthat's to do with his service.  At the end, speaking about the entrance\nhe says, 'Now I'll go and close it', although at the beginning of the\nstory it says the door to the law is open as it always is, but if it's\nalways open - always - that means it's open independently of the\nlifespan of the man it's intended for, and not even the doorkeeper will\nbe able to close it.  There are various opinions about this, some say\nthe doorkeeper was only answering a question or showing his devotion to\nduty or, just when the man was in his last moments, the doorkeeper\nwanted to cause him regret and sorrow.  There are many who agree that he\nwouldn't be able to close the door.  They even believe, at the end at\nleast, the doorkeeper is aware, deep down, that he's the man's\nsubordinate, as the man sees the light that shines out of the entry to\nthe law whereas the doorkeeper would probably have his back to it and\nsays nothing at all to show there's been any change.\"  \"That is well\nsubstantiated,\" said K., who had been repeating some parts of the\npriest's explanation to himself in a whisper.  \"It is well\nsubstantiated, and now I too think the doorkeeper must have been\ndeceived.  Although that does not mean I've abandoned what I thought\nearlier as the two versions are, to some extent, not incompatible. It's\nnot clear whether the doorkeeper sees clearly or is deceived.  I said\nthe man had been cheated.  If the doorkeeper understands clearly, then\nthere could be some doubt about it, but if the doorkeeper has been\ndeceived then the man is bound to believe the same thing.  That would\nmean the doorkeeper is not a cheat but so simple-minded that he ought to\nbe dismissed from his job immediately; if the doorkeeper is mistaken it\nwill do him no harm but the man will be harmed immensely.\"  \"There\nyou've found another opinion,\" said the priest, \"as there are many who\nsay the story doesn't give anyone the right to judge the doorkeeper.\nHowever he might seem to us he is still in the service of the law, so he\nbelongs to the law, so he's beyond what man has a right to judge.  In\nthis case we can't believe the doorkeeper is the man's subordinate.\nEven if he has to stay at the entrance into the law his service makes\nhim incomparably more than if he lived freely in the world.  The man has\ncome to the law for the first time and the doorkeeper is already there.\nHe's been given his position by the law, to doubt his worth would be to\ndoubt the law.\"  \"I can't say I'm in complete agreement with this view,\"\nsaid K. shaking his head, \"as if you accept it you'll have to accept\nthat everything said by the doorkeeper is true.  But you've already\nexplained very fully that that's not possible.\"  \"No,\" said the priest,\n\"you don't need to accept everything as true, you only have to accept it\nas necessary.\"  \"Depressing view,\" said K.  \"The lie made into the rule\nof the world.\"\n\n        K. said that as if it were his final word but it was not his\nconclusion.  He was too tired to think about all the ramifications of\nthe story, and the sort of thoughts they led him into were not familiar\nto him, unrealistic things, things better suited for officials of the\ncourt to discuss than for him.  The simple story had lost its shape, he\nwanted to shake it off, and the priest who now felt quite compassionate\nallowed this and accepted K.'s remarks without comment, even though his\nview was certainly very different from K.'s.\n\n        In silence, they carried on walking for some time, K. stayed close\nbeside the priest without knowing where he was.  The lamp in his hand\nhad long since gone out.  Once, just in front of him, he thought he\ncould see the statue of a saint by the glitter of the silver on it,\nalthough it quickly disappeared back into the darkness.  So that he\nwould not remain entirely dependent on the priest, K. asked him, \"We're\nnow near the main entrance, are we?\"  \"No,\" said the priest, \"we're a\nlong way from it.  Do you already want to go?\"  K. had not thought of\ngoing until then, but he immediately said,\n\"Yes, certainly, I have to go.  I'm the chief clerk in a bank and there\nare people waiting for me, I only came here to show a foreign business\ncontact round the cathedral.\"  \"Alright,\" said the priest offering him\nhis hand, \"go then.\"  \"But I can't find my way round in this darkness by\nmyself,\" said K.  \"Go to your left as far as the wall,\" said the priest,\n\"then continue alongside the wall without leaving it and you'll find a\nway out.\"  The priest had only gone a few paces from him, but K. was\nalready shouting loudly, \"Please, wait!\"  \"I'm waiting,\" said the\npriest.  \"Is there anything else you want from me?\" asked K.  \"No,\" said\nthe priest.  \"You were so friendly to me earlier on,\" said K., \"and you\nexplained everything, but now you abandon me as if I were nothing to\nyou.\"  \"You have to go,\" said the priest.\n\"Well, yes,\" said K., \"you need to understand that.\"  \"First, you need\nto understand who I am,\" said the priest.  \"You're the prison chaplain,\"\nsaid K., and went closer to the priest, it was not so important for him\nto go straight back to the bank as he had made out, he could very well\nstay where he was.  \"So that means I belong to the court,\" said the\npriest.  \"So why would I want anything from you?  the court doesn't want\nanything from you.  It accepts you when you come and it lets you go when\nyou leave.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter Ten\nEnd\n\n        The evening before K.'s thirty-first birthday - it was about nine\no'clock in the evening, the time when the streets were quiet - two men\ncame to where he lived.  In frock coats, pale and fat, wearing top hats\nthat looked like they could not be taken off their heads.  After some\nbrief formalities at the door of the flat when they first arrived, the\nsame formalities were repeated at greater length at K.'s door.  He had\nnot been notified they would be coming, but K. sat in a chair near the\ndoor, dressed in black as they were, and slowly put on new gloves which\nstretched tightly over his fingers and behaved as if he were expecting\nvisitors.  He immediately stood up and looked at the gentlemen\ninquisitively.  \"You've come for me then, have you?\" he asked.  The\ngentlemen nodded, one of them indicated the other with the top hand now\nin his hand.  K. told them he had been expecting a different visitor.\nHe went to the window and looked once more down at the dark street.\nMost of the windows on the other side of the street were also dark\nalready, many of them had the curtains closed.  In one of the windows on\nthe same floor where there was a light on, two small children could be\nseen playing with each other inside a playpen, unable to move from where\nthey were, reaching out for each other with their little hands.  \"Some\nancient, unimportant actors - that's what they've sent for me,\" said K.\nto himself, and looked round once again to confirm this to himself.\n\"They want to sort me out as cheaply as they can.\"  K. suddenly turned\nround to face the two men and asked, \"What theatre do you play in?\"\n\"Theatre?\" asked one of the gentlemen, turning to the other for\nassistance and pulling in the corners of his mouth.  The other made a\ngesture like someone who was dumb, as if he were struggling with some\norganism causing him trouble.  \"You're not properly prepared to answer\nquestions,\" said K. and went to fetch his hat.\n\n        As soon as they were on the stairs the gentlemen wanted to take\nK.'s arms, but K. said \"Wait till we're in the street, I'm not ill.\"\nBut they waited only until the front door before they took his arms in a\nway that K. had never experienced before.   They kept their shoulders\nclose behind his, did not turn their arms in but twisted them around the\nentire length of K.'s arms and took hold of his hands with a grasp that\nwas formal, experienced and could not be resisted.  K. was held stiff\nand upright between them, they formed now a single unit so that if any\none of them had been knocked down all of them must have fallen.  They\nformed a unit of the sort that normally can be formed only by matter\nthat is lifeless.\n\n        Whenever they passed under a lamp K. tried to see his companions\nmore clearly, as far as was possible when they were pressed so close\ntogether, as in the dim light of his room this had been hardly possible.\n\"Maybe they're tenors,\" he thought as he saw their big double chins.\nThe cleanliness of their faces disgusted him.  He could see the hands\nthat cleaned them, passing over the corners of their eyes, rubbing at\ntheir upper lips, scratching out the creases on those chins.\n\n        When K. noticed that, he stopped, which meant the others had to\nstop too; they were at the edge of an open square, devoid of people but\ndecorated with flower beds.  \"Why did they send you, of all people!\" he\ncried out, more a shout than a question.  The two gentleman clearly knew\nno answer to give, they waited, their free arms hanging down, like\nnurses when the patient needs to rest.  \"I will go no further,\" said K.\nas if to see what would happen.  The gentlemen did not need to make any\nanswer, it was enough that they did not loosen their grip on K. and\ntried to move him on, but K. resisted them.  \"I'll soon have no need of\nmuch strength, I'll use all of it now,\" he thought.   He thought of the\nflies that tear their legs off struggling to get free of the flypaper.\n\"These gentleman will have some hard work to do\".\n\n        Just then, Miss Buerstner came up into the square in front of them\nfrom the steps leading from a small street at a lower level.  It was not\ncertain that it was her, although the similarity was, of course, great.\nBut it did not matter to K. whether it was certainly her anyway, he just\nbecame suddenly aware that there was no point in his resistance.  There\nwould be nothing heroic about it if he resisted, if he now caused\ntrouble for these gentlemen, if in defending himself he sought to enjoy\nhis last glimmer of life.  He started walking, which pleased the\ngentlemen and some of their pleasure conveyed itself to him.  Now they\npermitted him to decide which direction they took, and he decided to\ntake the direction that followed the young woman in front of them, not\nso much because he wanted to catch up with her, nor even because he\nwanted to keep her in sight for as long as possible, but only so that he\nwould not forget the reproach she represented for him.   \"The only thing\nI can do now,\" he said to himself, and his thought was confirmed by the\nequal length of his own steps with the steps of the two others, \"the\nonly thing I can do now is keep my common sense and do what's needed\nright till the end.  I always wanted to go at the world and try and do\ntoo much, and even to do it for something that was not too cheap.  That\nwas wrong of me.  Should I now show them I learned nothing from facing\ntrial for a year?  Should I go out like someone stupid?  Should I let\nanyone say, after I'm gone, that at the start of the proceedings I\nwanted to end them, and that now that they've ended I want to start them\nagain?  I don't want anyone to say that.  I'm grateful they sent these\nunspeaking, uncomprehending men to go with me on this journey, and that\nit's been left up to me to say what's necessary\".\n\n        Meanwhile, the young woman had turned off into a side street, but\nK. could do without her now and let his companions lead him.  All three\nof them now, in complete agreement, went over a bridge in the light of\nthe moon, the two gentlemen were willing to yield to each little\nmovement made by K. as he moved slightly towards the edge and directed\nthe group in that direction as a single unit.  The moonlight glittered\nand quivered in the water, which divided itself around a small island\ncovered in a densely-piled mass of foliage and trees and bushes.\nBeneath them, now invisible, there were gravel paths with comfortable\nbenches where K. had stretched himself out on many summer's days.  \"I\ndidn't actually want to stop here,\" he said to his companions, shamed by\ntheir compliance with his wishes.  Behind K.'s back one of them seemed\nto quietly criticise the other for the misunderstanding about stopping,\nand then they went on.  The went on up through several streets where\npolicemen were walking or standing here and there; some in the distance\nand then some very close.   One of them with a bushy moustache, his hand\non the  grip of his sword, seemed to have some purpose in approaching\nthe group, which was hardly unsuspicious.  The two gentlemen stopped,\nthe policeman seemed about to open his mouth, and then K. drove his\ngroup forcefully forward.  Several times he looked back cautiously to\nsee if the policeman was following; but when they had a corner between\nthemselves and the policeman K. began to run, and the two gentlemen,\ndespite being seriously short of breath, had to run with him.\n\n        In this way they quickly left the built up area and found\nthemselves in the fields which, in this part of town, began almost\nwithout any transition zone.   There was a quarry, empty and abandoned,\nnear a building which was still like those in the city.  Here the men\nstopped, perhaps because this had always been their destination or\nperhaps because they were too exhausted to run any further.  Here they\nreleased their hold on K., who just waited in silence, and took their\ntop hats off while they looked round the quarry and wiped the sweat off\ntheir brows with their handkerchiefs.  The moonlight lay everywhere with\nthe natural peace that is granted to no other light.\n\n        After exchanging a few courtesies about who was to carry out the\nnext tasks - the gentlemen did not seem to have been allocated specific\nfunctions - one of them went to K. and took his coat, his waistcoat, and\nfinally his shirt off him.  K. made an involuntary shiver, at which the\ngentleman gave him a gentle, reassuring tap on the back.  Then he\ncarefully folded the things up as if they would still be needed, even if\nnot in the near future.  He did not want to expose K. to the chilly\nnight air without moving though, so he took him under the arm and walked\nup and down with him a little way while the other gentleman looked round\nthe quarry for a suitable place.  When he had found it he made a sign\nand the other gentleman escorted him there.  It was near the rockface,\nthere was a stone lying there that had broken loose.  The gentlemen sat\nK. down on the ground, leant him against the stone and settled his head\ndown on the top of it.  Despite all the effort they went to, and despite\nall the co-operation shown by K., his demeanour seemed very forced and\nhard to believe.  So one of the gentlemen asked the other to grant him a\nshort time while he put K. in position by himself, but even that did\nnothing to make it better.  In the end they left K. in a position that\nwas far from the best of the ones they had tried so far.  Then one of\nthe gentlemen opened his frock coat and from a sheath hanging on a belt\nstretched across his waistcoat he withdrew a long, thin, double-edged\nbutcher's knife which he held up in the light to test its sharpness.\nThe repulsive courtesies began once again, one of them passed the knife\nover K. to the other, who then passed it back over K. to the first.  K.\nnow knew it would be his duty to take the knife as it passed from hand\nto hand above him and thrust it into himself.  But he did not do it,\ninstead he twisted his neck, which was still free, and looked around.\nHe was not able to show his full worth, was not able to take all the\nwork from the official bodies, he lacked the rest of the strength he\nneeded and this final shortcoming was the fault of whoever had denied it\nto him.  As he looked round, he saw the top floor of the building next\nto the quarry.  He saw how a light flickered on and the two halves of a\nwindow opened out, somebody, made weak and thin by the height and the\ndistance, leant suddenly far out from it and stretched his arms out even\nfurther.  Who was that?  A friend?  A good person?  Somebody who was\ntaking part?  Somebody who wanted to help?  Was he alone?  Was it\neveryone?  Would anyone help?  Were there objections that had been\nforgotten?  There must have been some.  The logic cannot be refuted, but\nsomeone who wants to live will not resist it.  Where was the judge he'd\nnever seen?  Where was the high court he had never reached?  He raised\nboth hands and spread out all his fingers.\n\n        But the hands of one of the gentleman were laid on K.'s throat,\nwhile the other pushed the knife deep into his heart and twisted it\nthere, twice.  As his eyesight failed, K. saw the two gentlemen cheek by\ncheek, close in front of his face, watching the result. \"Like a dog!\" he\nsaid, it was as if the shame of it should outlive him.", "title": "The Trial"}

{"summary": "2000  was a leap year that started on a Saturday in the Christian or Common Era, according to the Gregorian calendar.", "full_text": "2000  was a century leap year starting on Saturday  of the Gregorian calendar, the 2000th year of the Common Era  and Anno Domini  designations, the 1000th and last year of the 2nd millennium, the 100th and last year of the 20th century, and the 1st year of the 2000s decade.\n2000 was designated as:\nInternational Year for the Culture of Peace\nWorld Mathematical Year\nPopular culture holds the year 2000 as the first year of the 21st century and the 3rd millennium due to a tendency of grouping the years according to decimal values, as if year zero were counted. According to the Gregorian Calendar, these distinctions fall to the year 2001 because the 1st century was retroactively said to start with year AD 1. Since the calendar does not have year zero, its first millennium spanned from years 1 to 1000 inclusively and its second millennium from years 1001 to 2000 .\nThe year 2000 is sometimes abbreviated as \"Y2K\" . The year 2000 was the subject of Y2K concerns, which are fears that computers would not shift from 1999 to 2000 correctly. However, by the end of 1999, many companies had already converted to new, or upgraded, existing software. Some even obtained Y2K certification. As a result of massive effort, relatively few problems occurred.", "title": "2000"}

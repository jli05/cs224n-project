{"summary": "Alesha Anjanette Dixon  is a British singer and television personality.", "full_text": "Alesha Dixon  is a British singer, dancer, rapper, model and television presenter from Welwyn Garden City, England. She found fame in the all-female R&B/garage trio Mis-Teeq. The trio disbanded in 2005 and Dixon pursued a music career as a solo artist, signing to Polydor Records. She began recording her debut solo album, Fired Up, in 2006, but due to poor record sales of her first two singles, \"Lipstick\" and \"Knockdown\", she was dropped from Polydor.\nIn 2007, Dixon won Strictly Come Dancing. Her television exposure led to a successful comeback, which included her signing to Asylum Records, an offshoot of Warner Music Group. Dixon then released a second album, entitled The Alesha Show, in 2008, which received platinum certification from BPI in the UK and spawned four singles including \"The Boy Does Nothing\" and \"Breathe Slow\", the latter of which became her highest charting single and earned her a Brit Award nomination.\nIn September 2009, Dixon became a judge on the seventh series of Strictly Come Dancing, replacing Arlene Phillips. The replacement of Phillips by Dixon attracted criticism, as some questioned the extent of Dixon's dancing knowledge. In 2010, Dixon returned for the eighth series of Strictly Come Dancing and released her third studio album, The Entertainer. In January 2012, shortly after completing the ninth series and her third year as a judge on Strictly Come Dancing, Dixon quit to become a judge on Britain's Got Talent.\n\n", "title": "Alesha Dixon"}

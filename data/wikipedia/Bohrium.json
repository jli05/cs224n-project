{"summary": "Bohrium is a chemical element.", "full_text": "Bohrium is a chemical element with symbol Bh and atomic number 107. It is named after Danish physicist Niels Bohr. It is a synthetic element  and radioactive; the most stable known isotope, 270Bh, has a half-life of approximately 61 seconds.\nIn the periodic table of the elements, it is a d-block transactinide element. It is a member of the 7th period and belongs to the group 7 elements. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that bohrium behaves as the heavier homologue to rhenium in group 7. The chemical properties of bohrium are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 7 elements.", "title": "Bohrium"}

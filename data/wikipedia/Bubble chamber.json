{"summary": "Donald Arthur Glaser  was an American physicist and neurobiologist.", "full_text": "A bubble chamber is a vessel filled with a superheated transparent liquid  used to detect electrically charged particles moving through it. It was invented in 1952 by Donald A. Glaser, for which he was awarded the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physics. Supposedly, Glaser was inspired by the bubbles in a glass of beer; however, in a 2006 talk, he refuted this story, although saying that while beer was not the inspiration for the bubble chamber, he did experiments using beer to fill early prototypes.\nCloud chambers work on the same principles as bubble chambers, but are based on supersaturated vapor rather than superheated liquid. While bubble chambers were extensively used in the past, they have now mostly been supplanted by wire chambers and spark chambers. Historically, notable bubble chambers include the Big European Bubble Chamber  and Gargamelle.", "title": "Bubble chamber"}

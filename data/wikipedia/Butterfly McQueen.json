Originally a dancer, McQueen first appeared in film in 1939 as Prissy, Scarlett O'Hara's maid, in the film Gone with the Wind. She was unable to attend the movie's premiere because it was held at a whites-only theater. McQueen also had a role on the controversial Beulah radio show. Often typecast as a maid, she said: \"I didn't mind playing a maid the first time, because I thought that was how you got into the business. But after I did the same thing over and over, I resented it. I didn't mind being funny, but I didn't like being stupid.\"\nShe continued as an actress in film in the 1940s then moved to television acting in the 1950s.", "title": "Butterfly McQueen"}

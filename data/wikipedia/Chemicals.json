{"summary": "A chemical substance is any material with a known chemical composition.", "full_text": "A chemical substance is a form of matter that has constant chemical composition and characteristic properties. It cannot be separated into components by physical separation methods, i.e., without breaking chemical bonds. Chemical substances can be chemical elements, chemical compounds, ions or alloys.\nChemical substances are often called 'pure' to set them apart from mixtures. A common example of a chemical substance is pure water; it has the same properties and the same ratio of hydrogen to oxygen whether it is isolated from a river or made in a laboratory. Other chemical substances commonly encountered in pure form are diamond , gold, table salt  and refined sugar . However, in practice, no substance is entirely pure, and chemical purity is specified according to the intended use of the chemical.\nChemical substances exist as solids, liquids, gases or plasma, and may change between these phases of matter with changes in temperature or pressure. Chemical reactions convert one chemical substance into another.\nForms of energy, such as light and heat, are not considered to be matter, and thus they are not \"substances\" in this regard.", "title": "Chemicals"}

{"summary": "Reductio ad absurdum is a Latin phrase which means \"reduction to the absurd\".", "full_text": "In classical logic, a contradiction consists of a logical incompatibility between two or more propositions. It occurs when the propositions, taken together, yield two conclusions which form the logical, usually opposite inversions of each other. Illustrating a general tendency in applied logic, Aristotle's law of noncontradiction states that \"One cannot say of something that it is and that it is not in the same respect and at the same time.\"\nBy extension, outside of classical logic, one can speak of contradictions between actions when one presumes that their motives contradict each other.", "title": "Contradiction"}

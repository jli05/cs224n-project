{"summary": "Gravity, or gravitation, is one of the fundamental forces of the universe.", "full_text": "For the economic concept, see Dynamic equilibrium \nIn chemistry, A dynamic equilibrium exists once a reversible reaction ceases to change its ratio of reactants/products, but substances move between the chemicals at an equal rate, meaning there is no net change. It is a particular example of a system in a steady state. In thermodynamics a closed system is in thermodynamic equilibrium when reactions occur at such rates that the composition of the mixture does not change with time. Reactions do in fact occur, sometimes vigorously, but to such an extent that changes in composition cannot be observed. Equilibrium constants can be expressed in terms of the rate constants for elementary reactions.", "title": "Dynamic equilibrium"}

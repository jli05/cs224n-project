{"summary": "Kinetic energy is the energy that an object has because of its motion.", "full_text": "Electric potential energy, or electrostatic potential energy, is a potential energy  that results from conservative Coulomb forces and is associated with the configuration of a particular set of point charges within a defined system. An object may have electric potential energy by virtue of two key elements: its own electric charge and its relative position to other electrically charged objects.\nThe term \"electric potential energy\" is used to describe the potential energy in systems with time-variant electric fields, while the term \"electrostatic potential energy\" is used to describe the potential energy in systems with time-invariant electric fields.", "title": "Electric potential energy"}

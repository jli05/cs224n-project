{"summary": "A foreign embassy is the official office of one country in the capital of another country.", "full_text": "A diplomatic mission is a group of people from one state or an international inter-governmental organisation  present in another state to represent the sending state/organisation officially in the receiving state. In practice, a diplomatic mission usually denotes the resident mission, namely the office of a country's diplomatic representatives in the capital city of another country. As well as being a diplomatic mission to the country in which it is situated, it may also be a non-resident permanent mission to one or more other countries. There are thus resident and non-resident embassies.", "title": "Embassy"}

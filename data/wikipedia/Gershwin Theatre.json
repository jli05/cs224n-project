{"summary": "2003  was a common year starting on Wednesday of the Gregorian calendar.", "full_text": "The Gershwin Theatre is a Broadway theatre located at 222 West 51st Street in midtown-Manhattan in the Paramount Plaza building. The theatre is named after composer George Gershwin and lyricist Ira Gershwin. It has the largest seating capacity of any Broadway theatre, with 1,933 seats.\nDesigned in an Art Nouveau style by set designer Ralph Alswang, it is situated on the lower levels of a towering office complex built at an estimated cost of $12.5 million on the site of the historical Capitol Theatre. It opened as the Uris Theatre on November 28, 1972  with the musical Via Galactica starring Raul Julia. It proved to be an inauspicious start for the venue, with the first show to lose a million dollars closing after only seven performances. From 1974-76 it served as a concert hall for limited engagements by a number of legendary pop music and jazz performers.\nThe American Theatre Hall of Fame is located in the lobby.\nDuring the 37th Tony Awards ceremony held June 5, 1983, the theatre was rechristened to honor the Gershwins.", "title": "Gershwin Theatre"}

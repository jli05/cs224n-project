In 2011, there were more than 924 million live goats around the globe, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.\nFemale goats are referred to as \"does\" or \"nannies\", intact males as \"bucks\", \"billies\", or \"rams\" and their offspring are \"kids\". Castrated males are \"wethers\". Goat meat from younger animals is called \"kid\" or cabrito , and from older animals is simply known as \"goat\" or sometimes called chevon , or in some areas \"mutton\" .", "title": "Goat"}

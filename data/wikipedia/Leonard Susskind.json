{"summary": "Physics, a branch of science, is the study of all forces and their impacts on the environment.", "full_text": "Leonard Susskind  is the Felix Bloch professor of Theoretical physics at Stanford University, and director of the Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics. His research interests include string theory, quantum field theory, quantum statistical mechanics and quantum cosmology. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences of the US, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, an associate member of the faculty of Canada's Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, and a distinguished professor of the Korea Institute for Advanced Study.\nSusskind is widely regarded as one of the fathers of string theory, having, with Yoichiro Nambu and Holger Bech Nielsen, independently introduced the idea that particles could in fact be states of excitation of a relativistic string. He was the first to introduce the idea of the string theory landscape in 2003.\nSusskind was awarded the 1998 J. J. Sakurai Prize.", "title": "Leonard Susskind"}

{"summary": "This is a list of the cities in the United States that have the largest populations.", "full_text": "The following is a list of the most populous incorporated places of the United States. As defined by the United States Census Bureau, an \"incorporated place\" includes a variety of designations, including city, town, village, borough, and municipality. A few exceptional Census Designated Places  are also included in the Census Bureau's listing of incorporated places. Consolidated city-counties represent a distinct type of government that includes the entire population of a county, or county equivalent. Some consolidated city-counties, however, include multiple incorporated places. This list presents only that portion  of such consolidated city-counties that are not a part of another incorporated place.\nThis list refers only to the population of individual municipalities within their defined limits, which does not include other municipalities or unincorporated suburban areas within urban agglomerations. A different ranking is evident when considering U.S. metropolitan area populations.", "title": "List of United States cities by population"}

{"summary": "A map is an image of an area, usually of the Earth or part of the Earth.", "full_text": "A map is a symbolic depiction highlighting relationships between elements of some space, such as objects, regions, and themes.\nMany maps are static two-dimensional, geometrically accurate  representations of three-dimensional space, while others are dynamic or interactive, even three-dimensional. Although most commonly used to depict geography, maps may represent any space, real or imagined, without regard to context or scale; e.g. brain mapping, DNA mapping and extraterrestrial mapping.\nAlthough the earliest maps known are of the heavens, geographic maps of territory have a very long tradition and exist from ancient times. The word \"map\" comes from the medieval Latin Mappa mundi, wherein mappa meant napkin or cloth and mundi the world. Thus, \"map\" became the shortened term referring to a two-dimensional representation of the surface of the world.", "title": "Map"}

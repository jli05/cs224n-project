{"summary": "Mathematics, sometimes shortened to maths  or math  is the study of numbers, shapes and patterns.", "full_text": "In the philosophy of mathematics, intuitionism, or neointuitionism , is an approach where mathematics is considered to be purely the result of the constructive mental activity of humans rather than the discovery of fundamental principles claimed to exist in an objective reality. That is, logic and mathematics are not considered analytic activities wherein deep properties of objective reality are revealed and applied but are instead considered the application of internally consistent methods used to realize more complex mental constructs, regardless of their possible independent existence in an objective reality.", "title": "Mathematical intuitionism"}

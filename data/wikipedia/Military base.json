{"summary": "Gibraltar is an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom.", "full_text": "A military base is a facility directly owned and operated by or for the military or one of its branches that shelters military equipment and personnel, and facilitates training and operations. In general, a military base provides accommodations for one or more units, but it may also be used as a command center, a training ground, or a proving ground. In most cases, a military base relies on some outside help in order to operate. However, certain complex bases are able to endure by themselves for long periods because they are able to provide food, water and other life support necessities for their inhabitants while under siege.\nThe military sense of the term base dates from the 1860s.", "title": "Military base"}

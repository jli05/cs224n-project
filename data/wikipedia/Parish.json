{"summary": "A parish is the area which is served by a church.", "full_text": "A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor .\nBy extension the term parish refers not only to the territorial unit but to the people of its community or congregation as well as to church property within it. In England this church property was technically in ownership of the parish priest ex-officio, vested in him on his institution to that parish.\n^ Michael Trueman and Pete Vere , \"When Parishes Merge or Close\", Catholic Answers 18 ", "title": "Parish"}

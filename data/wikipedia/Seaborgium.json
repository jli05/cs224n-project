{"summary": "Seaborgium is a chemical element.", "full_text": "Seaborgium is a synthetic element with symbol Sg and atomic number 106. Its most stable isotope 271Sg has a half-life of 1.9 minutes. A more recently discovered isotope 269Sg has a potentially slightly longer half-life  based on the observation of a single decay. Chemistry experiments with seaborgium have firmly placed it in group 6 as a heavier homologue to tungsten. Seaborgium is named after Glenn T. Seaborg who was alive at the time the naming was publicized.", "title": "Seaborgium"}

{"summary": "Sonar is a machine that uses underwater sound waves to find other objects in the sea.", "full_text": "Sonar  is a technique that uses sound propagation  to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water, such as other vessels. Two types of technology share the name \"sonar\": passive sonar is essentially listening for the sound made by vessels; active sonar is emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes. Sonar may be used as a means of acoustic location and of measurement of the echo characteristics of \"targets\" in the water. Acoustic location in air was used before the introduction of radar. Sonar may also be used in air for robot navigation, and SODAR  is used for atmospheric investigations. The term sonar is also used for the equipment used to generate and receive the sound. The acoustic frequencies used in sonar systems vary from very low  to extremely high . The study of underwater sound is known as underwater acoustics or hydroacoustics.", "title": "Sonar"}

{"summary": "The Stasi was the official state security service of East Germany, the German Democratic Republic or GDR.", "full_text": "The Ministry for State Security , commonly known as the Stasi  , also State Security Service , was the official state security service of the German Democratic Republic , or Deutsche Demokratische Republik , colloquially known as East Germany. It has been described as one of the most effective and repressive intelligence and secret police agencies to have ever existed. The Stasi was headquartered in East Berlin, with an extensive complex in Berlin-Lichtenberg and several smaller facilities throughout the city. The Stasi motto was \"Schild und Schwert der Partei\" , referring to the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany .\nOne of its main tasks was spying on the population, mainly through a vast network of citizens turned informants, and fighting any opposition by overt and covert measures, including hidden psychological destruction of dissidents . Its Main Directorate for Reconnaissance  was responsible for both espionage and for conducting covert operations in foreign countries. Under its long-time head Markus Wolf, it gained a reputation as one of the most effective intelligence agencies of the Cold War. Numerous Stasi officials were prosecuted for their crimes after 1990. After German reunification, the surveillance files that the Stasi had maintained on millions of East Germans were laid open, so that any citizen could inspect their personal file on request; these files are now maintained by the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records.", "title": "Stasi"}

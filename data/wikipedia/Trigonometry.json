{"summary": "Trigonometry  is a part of elementary mathematics dealing with angles, triangles and trigonometric functions such as sine , cosine  and tangent .", "full_text": "Trigonometry  is a branch of mathematics that studies relationships involving lengths and angles of triangles. The field emerged in the Hellenistic world during the 3rd century BC from applications of geometry to astronomical studies.\nThe 3rd-century astronomers first noted that the lengths of the sides of a right-angle triangle and the angles between those sides have fixed relationships: that is, if at least the length of one side and the value of one angle is known, then all other angles and lengths can be determined algorithmically. These calculations soon came to be defined as the trigonometric functions and today are pervasive in both pure and applied mathematics: fundamental methods of analysis such as the Fourier transform, for example, or the wave equation, use trigonometric functions to understand cyclical phenomena across many applications in fields as diverse as physics, mechanical and electrical engineering, music and acoustics, astronomy, ecology, and biology. Trigonometry is also the foundation of surveying.\nTrigonometry is most simply associated with planar right-angle triangles . The applicability to non-right-angle triangles exists, but, since any non-right-angle triangle  can be bisected to create two right-angle triangles, most problems can be reduced to calculations on right-angle triangles. Thus the majority of applications relate to right-angle triangles. One exception to this is spherical trigonometry, the study of triangles on spheres, surfaces of constant positive curvature, in elliptic geometry . Trigonometry on surfaces of negative curvature is part of hyperbolic geometry.\nTrigonometry basics are often taught in schools, either as a separate course or as a part of a precalculus course.", "title": "Trigonometry"}

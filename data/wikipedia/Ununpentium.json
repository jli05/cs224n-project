{"summary": "Ununpentium is a chemical element.", "full_text": "Ununpentium is the temporary name of a synthetic superheavy element in the periodic table that has the temporary symbol Uup and has the atomic number 115. It is an extremely radioactive element; its most stable known isotope, ununpentium-289, has a half-life of only 220 milliseconds. It is also known as eka-bismuth or simply element 115. Ununpentium was first created in 2003 by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, although this discovery is still awaiting confirmation by IUPAC. About 100 atoms of ununpentium have been observed to date, all of which have been shown to have mass numbers from 287 to 290.\nIn the periodic table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It is a member of the 7th period and is placed in group 15 as the heaviest pnictogen, although it has not been confirmed to behave as the heavier homologue to the pnictogen bismuth. Ununpentium is calculated to have some similar properties to its lighter homologues, nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth, although it should also show several major differences from them.", "title": "Ununpentium"}

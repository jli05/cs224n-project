{"summary": "The Nobel Prize in Physics is a Nobel Prize in the science of Physics.", "full_text": "Wilhelm Carl Werner Otto Fritz Franz Wien  was a German physicist who, in 1893, used theories about heat and electromagnetism to deduce Wien's displacement law, which calculates the emission of a blackbody at any temperature from the emission at any one reference temperature.\nHe also formulated an expression for the black-body radiation which is correct in the photon-gas limit. His arguments were based on the notion of adiabatic invariance, and were instrumental for the formulation of quantum mechanics. Wien received the 1911 Nobel Prize for his work on heat radiation.", "title": "Wilhelm Wien"}
